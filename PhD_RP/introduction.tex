\chapter{Introduction}


This proposal is about simple dynamical networks, with dynamics
that are described either by a stochastic rate equation
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{dp_n}{dt} \quad = \quad \sum_m w_{nm}p_m
\end{align}
%
or by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation:
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\psi_n}{dt} \quad = \quad \sum_m \mathcal{H}_{nm}\psi_m
\end{align}
%

Regardless of the governing equation, the focus is
on disordered sparse networks, with wide distribution of energies. 
Two related aspects of these networks will be studied: their energy spectrum,
and their spreading properties. More specifically, we wish to determine
whether the networks are diffusive ($S(t)\sim t$), or sub-diffusive, and
if they are indeed diffusive, what is the diffusion coefficient. 




To simplify the discussion, we concentrate on $d$-dimensional spatial networks,
in which each node has a defined location $x_n$, and each edge has an associated 
energy barrier $\epsilon_{nm}$. The transition rates are then defined to be:
%
\begin{align}
w_{nm} \quad = \quad w_0 \eexp{-\epsilon_{nm}}B(x_n-x_m)
\end{align}
%
Where $B(r)$ describes the dependence of the coupling on the
distance between sites.


The model we start with has its sites distributed randomly and uniformly throughout
a $d$-dimensional hypercube, with $B(r) = \exp(-r/\xi)$. The disorder is defined by the location
of the sites, and its effect on the connectivity of the network can be manipulated through the 
parameter $\xi$.

\section{matrix categories}\label{sec:matrix_categories}

% Three categories:
% wnm = wmn  - no talk about steady state - equilibrium transient diffusion
%%            resnet
% wnm propto wmn - detailed balance - stochastic field
%           integral over it must be zero  boltzmann equil
%           should be added to the background
% wnm \ne wmn - assymetry - frustrated NESS

In general, the transition matrices have three symmetry categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    $w_{nm} = w_{mn}$ \ -\ In the symmetric case the system could reach
      equilibrium and ergodicity. The transient behavior might be diffusive. 
      This kind of system has the analog of a Resistor Network, which is often
      useful both analytically and numerically.
  \item
    $w_{nm} = \exp{-\frac{E_n-E_m}{T}} w_{mn}$\ -\ This is called detailed balance,
      and allows the system to reach Boltzmann's equilibrium. One could make
      the analogy of a "stochastic field", $\varepsilon(x) = \frac{E_n-E_m}{T}$.
      Any closed loop integral over such a field must equal zero.
      Note that any product of a symmetric operator with a diagonal operator
      can be said to satisfy detailed balance \cite{kologromov_zur_1936}
  \item
    $w_{nm} \ne w_{mn}$\ -\ In the assymetric case, a Non Equilibrium Steady
      State (NESS) might be reached. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivations for the model}
%% bullets - where does this model appear - balls and springs (leads to heat) - capacitors
%%             - conductance hopping

We have kept the model abstract and general on purpose, so that it
might fit a large number of physical situations. Some physical applications include:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Balls and Springs\ - \ A simple mechanical system of balls connected to each
      other by springs. The vibrational modes of the system are phonons, which conduct heat.
  \item
    Capacitors and Resistors\ -\ An electrical network of capacitors connected to each other
      by resistors.
  \item 
    Mott impurity hopping\ - \ This kind of conductance arises from hopping 
      between impurities.
\end{itemize}

In past work \cite{PRL_2000} 

In a model described by a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$,
according to the first step of perturbation theory,
for very short time the transition probability is:
%
\begin{align}
WRONG p(n, n_0)\ =\ \left| \epsilon \bra{n} \mathcal{H}\ket{n_0}\right|^2
\end{align}
