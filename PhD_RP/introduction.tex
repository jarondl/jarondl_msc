\chapter{Introduction}


This proposal is about simple dynamical networks, with dynamics
that are described either by a stochastic rate equation
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{dp_n}{dt} \quad = \quad \sum_m w_{nm}p_m
\end{align}
%
or by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation:
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\psi_n}{dt} \quad = \quad \sum_m \mathcal{H}_{nm}\psi_m
\end{align}
%

Regardless of the governing equation, the focus is
on disordered sparse networks, with wide distribution of energies. 
Two related aspects of these networks will be studied: their energy spectrum,
and their spreading properties. More specifically, we wish to determine
whether the networks are diffusive ($S(t)\sim t$), or sub-diffusive, and
if they are indeed diffusive, what is the diffusion coefficient. 




To simplify the discussion, we concentrate on $d$-dimensional spatial networks,
in which each node has a defined location $x_n$, and each edge has an associated 
energy barrier $\epsilon_{nm}$. The transition rates are then defined to be:
%
\begin{align}
w_{nm} \quad = \quad w_0 \eexp{-\epsilon_{nm}}B(x_n-x_m)
\end{align}
%
Where $B(r)$ describes the dependence of the coupling on the
distance between sites.


The model we start with has its sites distributed randomly and uniformly throughout
a $d$-dimensional hypercube, with $B(r) = \exp(-r/\xi)$. The disorder is defined by the location
of the sites, and its effect on the connectivity of the network can be manipulated through the 
parameter $\xi$.

\section{Matrices of interest}\label{sec:matrix_categories}


The matrices we consider can be charactarized by several properties,  
in order of increasing complexity
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        \label{symmetric} Symmetry.
    \item
        \label{detailed_balance} Detailed balance.
    \item
       \label{assymetric} Frustration.
    \item 
       \label{diagonal} Diagonal disorder
    \item
       \label{active} Passive vs.\ active elements
    \item
       \label{relaxation} Relaxation vs.\ oscilation.
\end{enumerate}
%
Symmetric matrices (\ref{symmetric}) have
%
\begin{align}
w_{nm}=w_{mn}
\end{align}
%
In the long time dynamics these systems reach ergodicity, where every 
site has equal occupency. They also have the analogy to a
simple resistor network, which is useful both numerically and analyticaly. 


The detailed balance matrices (\ref{detailed_balance}) have specific 
requiremnts for the ratio between $w_{nm}$ and $w_{mn}$, see \ref{sec:detailed_balance}.
Their long term dynamics lead to Bolzmann's equilibrium. 


Frustrated matrices (\ref{assymetric}) are assymetric matrices 
that do not obey the detailed balance requirement.  
They do not reach equilibrium nor ergodicity, but they can reach
a non equilibrium steady state (NESS). 





To complete the definition of the matrices, we must define the diagonals.
For some networks, the
natural definition of the diagonal is by demanding the sum of each row to 
be equal to zero, meaning:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:zero_sum}
w_{nn} = -\sum_{m\ne n} w_{mn}
\end{align}
%
This represents conservation of charge, probability or momentum
in the model, and it has very important aspects, such as creating a totally ergodized mode,
with $\lambda=0$ and equal probabilities for all the sites. This is divergence 
of the Anderson localization length, and it might allow diffusion despite 
disorder in the system.


Another way to treat the diagonal is with some disorder, such as in the
Wigner model.

\section{Motivations for the model}
%% bullets - where does this model appear - balls and springs (leads to heat) - capacitors
%%             - conductance hopping

We have kept the model abstract and general on purpose, so that it
might fit a large number of physical situations. Some physical applications include:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Balls and Springs\ - \ A simple mechanical system of balls connected to each
      other by springs. The vibrational modes of the system are phonons, which conduct heat.
  \item
    Capacitors and Resistors\ -\ An electrical network of capacitors connected to each other
      by resistors.
  \item 
    Mott impurity hopping\ - \ This kind of conductance arises from hopping 
      between impurities.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Anderson localization}\label{sec:anderson}

In the Anderson model\cite{anderson_absence_1958}, a nearest neighbor network is formed
on a lattice. The bonds are all equal, and the on-site energies are random.
For $d=1$ and $d=2$, all states are localized, while for $d>2$, there exists
a transition between localized and extended modes. The common knowledge
is that every uncorrelated disorder causes localization. However, if the system
has an ergodic mode, i.e.\ every site has the same occupancy, then the localization length 
diverges, practically meaning effective delocalization. Moreover, if the energy
of this mode sits on the lower edge of the spectrum, this effective delocalization 
causes regular diffusion.


%The expressions for \emph{dc} conductivity and average conductance 
%\cite{kubo_statistical-mechanical_1957,greenwood,thouless_electrons_1974,braun_level_1997}
% can be written as
%
%\begin{align}
%\sigma &= \frac{\pi e^2}{m^2 V} \sum_{\alpha,\beta} 
%                 \left|\bra\alpha |\hat{p}|\beta\ket\right|^2 \delta(E_F-E_\alpha)\delta(E_F-E_\beta) \\
%\langle G \rangle &= \langle \sigma \rangle L^{d-2}
%\end{align}
%



There are several routines used to distinguish between exponentially localized and delocalized modes.
The most straight forward one seems to be the participation number (PN) 
\cite{edwards_numerical_1972}, which is defined by its inverse:
%
\begin{align}
PN^{-1} \ =\ \sum_i p_i^2
\end{align}
where $p_i$ is the probability to be in a specific site, equal to $|\psi_i|^2$ 
for a quantum wave function. For a fully extended mode $PN\sim N$, while for a state
occupying only one site $PN = 1 $.


Another idea called Thouless curvature or Thouless conductance 
\cite{edwards_numerical_1972,thouless_electrons_1974,braun_level_1997}, is based
on the idea that localized eigenmodes are almost not sensitive to boundary conditions. We apply a 
phase change $\phi$ across the boundary, (due to gauge invariance the specific spot is irrelevant),
and check the resulting change in the eigenvalues. 
In an ordered system with extended modes, $\phi=\pi$ will cause an energy
shift larger than the level spacing. 
Using perturbation theory on Kubo's equation \cite{kubo_statistical-mechanical_1957},
Thouless defined a conductance that is proportional to the diffusion: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:thouless}
\bra g_T\ket  \equiv \pi \frac{\bra \left|\left. \frac{\partial ^2 E^{(n)}}{\partial \phi^2}\right|_{\phi\rightarrow 0}\right|\ket}{\Delta}
\end{align}
where $\Delta$ is the level spacing.



Because we have defined the diagonal by requiring each row and column to nullify,
there always exists a special extended $\lambda=0$ mode with all probabilities equal. 
Actually, in our $d\le 2$ models, the localization length diverges as $\lambda\rightarrow 0$,
So that while the states are localized by definition, in practice they may be very wide
compared to the system length.

\section{Modeling quantum diffusion with resistor networks}

%In past work \cite{cohen_wave_2000} 

In a model described by a Hamiltonian 
%
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H} = \textrm{diag}{E_n} + \epsilon {V_{nm}}
\end{align}
%
according to the first step of perturbation theory,
for very short time the transition probability is:
%
\begin{align}
 p(n, n_0)\ =\ \left| \epsilon \bra n| V |n_0\ket t\right|^2 \ = \ \epsilon^2 t^2\left| \bra n| V |n_0\ket \right|^2
\end{align}
%
This suggests that for some short time scale, the ballistic behavior
of the system might relate to the conductivity of the rate equation $G_{nm} = \left| \bra n| V |n_0\ket \right|^2$.

\section{Heat conductance}

One can take one of our suggested models, and couple each end to a different heat bath.
The total heat conductance of the sample is defined by:
\begin{align}
J = \int_0^\infty \rho(\lambda) g(\lambda) d\lambda
\end{align}
where $\rho(\omega)$ is the density of states, and $g(\lambda)$ is 
a transmission coefficient for a phonon at energy $\lambda$.
 
However, many one-dimensional models 
\cite{narayan_anomalous_2002,dhar_heat_2001,lepri_anomalous_1998,savin_heat_2002} 
exhibit sample size scaling of the form
%
\begin{align}
g(\lambda)    &\propto L^\alpha
\end{align}

It is debated whether for $d=1$ systems
with momentum conservation,  $\alpha=1/3$,$\alpha=2/5$ or neither
\cite{narayan_anomalous_2002,delfini_comment_2008,dhar_dhar_2008,wang_power-law_2011}.
For several systems it has been shown that $\alpha$ depends on some tunable potential \cite{tong_wave_1999},
and it also depends on the spectrum of the baths \cite{dhar_heat_2001}.



$g(\lambda)$ is highly affected by the localization length of this mode, 
and one way to find it is via Thouless' curvature \autoref{eq:thouless}.
The high frequency eigenmodes are strongly localized, hence only the
first part of the spectrum contributes to the heat flux. Based on this idea,
the heat flux can be estimated \cite{lepri_thermal_2001,bodyfelt_unpub},
by the number of wide modes.

\section{Banded matrices spectrum}


For wide bandwidth and uncorrelated matrix elements, the high eigenvalues
should follow the Wigner semicircle law ($g(\lambda) = \frac{2}{\pi R^2}\sqrt{R^2-\lambda^2}$)
\cite{erdos_local_2012,fyodorov_scaling_1991,wigner_characteristic_1955}. However,
the low eigenvalues can still follow other rules, allowing for a transition
between diffusion and subdiffusion.

%For example, by adding spatial correlations, the behavior can be changed 
%from $S(t) \sim (\log t)^4$ to $S(t) \sim (\log t)^y$ with $y \in [4,\inf]$ \cite{stanley_generalisation_1987}.
