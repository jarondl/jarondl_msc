\chapter{Introduction}


This proposal is about simple dynamical networks, with dynamics
that are described either by a stochastic rate equation
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{dp_n}{dt} \quad = \quad \sum_m w_{nm}p_m
\end{align}
%
or by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation:
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\psi_n}{dt} \quad = \quad \sum_m \mathcal{H}_{nm}\psi_m
\end{align}
%

Regardless of the governing equation, the focus is
on disordered sparse networks, with wide distribution of energies. 
Two related aspects of these networks will be studied: their energy spectrum,
and their spreading properties. More specifically, we wish to determine
whether the networks are diffusive ($S(t)\sim t$), or sub-diffusive, and
if they are indeed diffusive, what is the diffusion coefficient. 




To simplify the discussion, we concentrate on $d$-dimensional spatial networks,
in which each node has a defined location $x_n$, and each edge has an associated 
energy barrier $\epsilon_{nm}$. The transition rates are then defined to be:
%
\begin{align}
w_{nm} \quad = \quad w_0 \eexp{-\epsilon_{nm}}B(x_n-x_m)
\end{align}
%
Where $B(r)$ describes the dependence of the coupling on the
distance between sites.


The model we start with has its sites distributed randomly and uniformly throughout
a $d$-dimensional hypercube, with $B(r) = \exp(-r/\xi)$. The disorder is defined by the location
of the sites, and its effect on the connectivity of the network can be manipulated through the 
parameter $\xi$.

\section{Matrix categories}\label{sec:matrix_categories}

% Three categories:
% wnm = wmn  - no talk about steady state - equilibrium transient diffusion
%%            resnet
% wnm propto wmn - detailed balance - stochastic field
%           integral over it must be zero  boltzmann equil
%           should be added to the background
% wnm \ne wmn - assymetry - frustrated NESS

In general, the transition matrices have three symmetry categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    $w_{nm} = w_{mn}$ \ -\ In the symmetric case the system could reach
      equilibrium and ergodicity. The transient behavior might be diffusive. 
      This kind of system has the analog of a Resistor Network, which is often
      useful both analytically and numerically.
  \item
    $w_{nm} = \exp{-\frac{E_n-E_m}{T}} w_{mn}$\ -\ This is called detailed balance,
      and allows the system to reach Boltzmann's equilibrium. One could make
      the analogy of a "stochastic field", $\varepsilon(x) = \frac{E_n-E_m}{T}$.
      Any closed loop integral over such a field must equal zero.
      Note that any product of a symmetric operator with a diagonal operator
      can be said to satisfy detailed balance \cite{kolmogoroff_zur_1936}
  \item
    $w_{nm} \ne w_{mn}$\ -\ In the assymetric case, a Non Equilibrium Steady
      State (NESS) might be reached. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivations for the model}
%% bullets - where does this model appear - balls and springs (leads to heat) - capacitors
%%             - conductance hopping

We have kept the model abstract and general on purpose, so that it
might fit a large number of physical situations. Some physical applications include:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Balls and Springs\ - \ A simple mechanical system of balls connected to each
      other by springs. The vibrational modes of the system are phonons, which conduct heat.
  \item
    Capacitors and Resistors\ -\ An electrical network of capacitors connected to each other
      by resistors.
  \item 
    Mott impurity hopping\ - \ This kind of conductance arises from hopping 
      between impurities.
\end{itemize}

\section{Relationship with Anderson localization}

In the Anderson model\cite{anderson_absence_1958}, a nearest neighbor network is formed
on a lattice. The bonds are all equal, and the on-site energies are random.
For $d=1$ and $d=2$, all states are localized, while for $d>2$, there exists
a transition between localized and extended modes. 


The expression for conductivity\cite{kubo,greenwood,thouless_electrons_1974} can be written as
%
\begin{align}
\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\pi e^2}{\Omega} \sum_\alpha \sum_{\beta\ne\alpha} 
                 \hat{x}_{\alpha\beta}\hat{x}_{\beta\alpha}\delta(E_\alpha-E_\beta - \hbar\omega)(f_\beta-f_\alpha)\omega
\end{align}
%

There are several routines used to distinguish between exponentially localized and delocalized modes.
The most straight forward one seems to be the participation number (PN) 
\cite{edwards_numerical_1972}, which is defined by its inverse:
%
\begin{align}
PN^{-1} \ =\ \sum_i p_i^2
\end{align}
where $p_i$ is the probability to be in a specific site, equal to $|\psi_i|^2$ 
for a quantum wave function.


\cite{edwards_numerical_1972}

\section{Modeling quantum diffusion with resistor networks}

In past work \cite{cohen_wave_2000} 

In a model described by a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$,
according to the first step of perturbation theory,
for very short time the transition probability is:
%
\begin{align}
WRONG p(n, n_0)\ =\ \left| \epsilon \bra{n} \mathcal{H}\ket{n_0}\right|^2
\end{align}
%

\section{Heat conductance}

One can take one of our suggested models, and couple each end to a different heat bath.
In steady state, it is expected that the heat current will obey Fourier's law:
%
\begin{align}
j = -\kappa\nabla T
\end{align}
%
Assuming $\kappa$ does not change significantly with temperature, a given 
temperature difference $\delta T$ over sample length $L$ should yield:
%
\begin{align}
j = \frac{\kappa \delta T}{L}
\end{align}
%
However, many one-dimensional models 
\cite{narayan_anomalous_2002,dhar_heat_2001,lepri_anomalous_1998,savin_heat_2002} 
exhibit sample size scaling of the form
%
\begin{align}
j         &\propto L^{\alpha-1}\quad [\alpha>0] \\
\kappa    &\propto L^\alpha
\end{align}

It is debated whether for $d=1$ systems
with momentum conservation,  $\alpha=1/3$,$\alpha=2/5$ or neither
\cite{narayan_anomalous_2002,delfini_comment_2008,dhar_dhar_2008,wang_power-law_2011}.



The high frequency eigenmodes are strongly localized, hence only the
first part of the spectrum contributes to the heat flux\cite{lepri_thermal_2001}.
localization


In the harmonic chain model, $N$ equal masses connected by springs are described by a classical Hamiltonian:
%
\begin{align}
\mathcal{H} &= \sum_n \left( \frac{p_n^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j} \frac{1}{2}k_{nj} (x_n-x_j)^2 \right) \\
            &= \sum_{n} \frac{p_n^2}{2m} +  \frac{1}{2}\vec{x}^{\intercal} K \vec{x} \\
            K_{ij} &= \begin{cases} 
            \sum_{n\ne i} k_{in}  \quad &\textrm{if}\quad i=j \\ 
            - k_{ij}  \quad &\textrm{if}\quad i\ne j 
            \end{cases}\\
            \vec{x} &= (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N)
\end{align}
%

\section{About banded matrices}


For wide bandwidth and uncorrelated matrix elements, the high eigenvalues
should follow the Wigner semicircle law ($g(\lambda) = \frac{2}{\pi R^2}\sqrt{R^2-\lambda^2}$)
\cite{erdos_local_2012,fyodorov_scaling_1991,wigner_characteristic_1955}. However,
the low eigenvalues can still follow other rules, allowing for a transition
between diffusion and subdiffusion.



Some facts about banded matrices, with 
\begin{align}
  w_{ij} = 
  \begin{cases}
    1 \quad &\textrm{  if  } |i-j|\le b   \\
    -\sum_{k \ne j} w_{kj} &\textrm{  if  } i = j  \\
    0 \quad &\textrm{  otherwise }
  \end{cases}
\end{align}

The analytical eigenvalues are:
\begin{align}
  \lambda &= 2\sum_{n=1..b} (\cos(n\cdot k) -1) \\
  k &= \frac{2\pi m}{N}
\end{align}

\section{Sinai diffusion}



For example, by adding spatial correlations, the behavior can be changed 
from $S(t) \sim (\log t)^4$ to $S(t) \sim (\log t)^y$ with $y \in [4,\inf]$ \cite{stanley_generalisation_1987}.
