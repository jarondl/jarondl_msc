% They deal with the spectra of complex networks (sometimes sparse),
% finding that the high eigenvalues have tails
% and do not obey Wigner's law..

%They consider $d$ dimensional spatial embedded networks, and even have
%a very similar matrix (13). 

%% I suggest to add both dorogovtsev and bradde to the introduction,
%% with something like:
%  Our model is a sparse spatialy embedded network.
%  The high eigenvalues of sparse or spatialy embedded networks
%  have some .. features..   I don't know... but both Dorogovtsev and Bianconi 
% were mentioned by ref C.

% It describes a definition for an effective diffusion constant,
% and if I understand correctly it says that we should always have
% diffusion in our system.
%  This could be added as another ref to the line
% "Our approach is inspired by the resistor network picture"
