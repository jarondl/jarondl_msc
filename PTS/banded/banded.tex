\title{Banded matrices with log-box distribution}

\author{Yaron de Leeuw}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

We treat banded matrices with a width of $2b$. The values 
are $w = w_0e^{-\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon \in [0,2\sigma]$ is box distributed,
and therefore $w$ is log-box distributed in the range $[w_0e^{-2\sigma}, w_0]$.


According to linear response, we have:
\begin{align}
   D= \sum_r w(r,\epsilon)r^2
\end{align}
We will define $r_0\equiv 1$, and recall that $w$ does not depend on $r$.
The sum over $r^2$ is therefore simply a sum from $1$ to $b$:
\begin{align}
   D= \sum_{r=1}^b w(r,\epsilon) r^2 = \frac{b(b+1)(2b+1)}{6} w(\epsilon)
\end{align}
We average over $\epsilon$ to arrive at:
\begin{align}
   D_0 = \frac{b(b+1)(2b+1)}{6} \int_0^{2\sigma} w_0e^{-\epsilon} = \frac{b(b+1)(2b+1)}{6} w_0\left(1-e^{-2\sigma}\right)\frac{1}{2\sigma}
\end{align}

Using this expected LRT diffusion, we can now check the validity of our Diffusion-coefficient finding methods. 
We can expect that for low $\sigma$ , and especially for $\sigma=0$, the LRT result should be correct, as $w(\epsilon)=w_0$.

\section{Eigenvalue fitting}
The first method I will check is the eigenvalue distribution fitting method. We can see that, for example, with $s=0$ and $b=20$ the eigenvalues do obey a linear distribution.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\hsize]{banded_s_0_b20}
\end{figure} 

This means that we may try to use the eigenvalue fitting method for all values of $s$ and $b$:
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{fit}
\caption{This is a plot of $D/D_0$ as calculated using the fitting method. $1$ (red) is good. \bf{ In all of the matshow plots, the y-axis is $b$ and the x-axis is $s$}}
\end{figure} 
We see that the calculated diffusion matches the LRT estimate for $s=0$ as expected, but is smaller for larger $s$ with small $b$.
This might mean that this "measurement" might be the correct one.

\section{Resistor network}
Before I proceed with to ERH, I wanted to make sure the other measurement we have would produce meaningfull results.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{new_resnet}
\caption{This is a plot of $D/D_0$ as calculated using the "new" resistor network method.}
\end{figure} 
We can see that the resistor network fails even for $s=0$. I am not sure whether to attribute it to the method (meaning SLRT doesn't hold for $b=40$ and $s=0$, or to 
a mistaken implementation.

To debug, I have returned to the basics. Using a $1000x1000$ matrix, with $b=40$ and $s=0$, I have pseudo - inverted the $W$ matrix to obtain $W^{-1}$. 
Then, I constructed a zero-filled vector $I$, with $(-1)$ on site 250, and $(+1)$ on site 750 (there are 1000 sites overall).
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{voltage_b40}
\caption{This is a plot of $V=W^{-1}I$}
\end{figure} 
We can see in the plot large voltage bumps where the current has been applied. We can also see a voltage drop after $b$ sites. I have tried to take the voltage bump out of the calculation, by measuring the voltage after the voltage drop. The resulting $D(s,b)$ is plotted next:
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{resnet3}
\caption{This is a plot of $D/D_0$, using the resistor network method, measuring voltage $b$ steps inwards.}
\end{figure} 
As we can see this mearly decreased $D$ by a small amount. This image is less streamlined because it is not averaged like the "new resistor network" is.

\section{ERH}
So of the two measurements, resistor network and eigenvalue fitting, only eigenvalue fitting holds for large $b$, so we will use this from now on.

To apply the ERH method, we first have to find the cut-off $w*$, or, as is easier, find $\epsilon*$.
\begin{align}
\iint_{w>w*} \rho(r,\epsilon) dr d\epsilon = P_c \\
\iint_{\epsilon<\epsilon*} b\cdot f(\epsilon) d\epsilon = b\cdot\frac{\epsilon*}{2\sigma} = P_c\\
\epsilon* = \frac{2\sigma P_c}{b}
\end{align}

Now, we integrate over $min(w(r,\epsilon*),w(r,epsilon))r^2$ to obtain:
\begin{align}
   D_\textrm{ERH} &= \frac{b(b+1)(2b+1)}{6}(\int_0^{\epsilon*}w_0e^{-\epsilon*}\frac{d\epsilon}{2\sigma} +  \int_{\epsilon*}^{2\sigma} w_0e^{-\epsilon})\frac{d\epsilon}{2\sigma} \\
   &= \frac{b(b+1)(2b+1)}{6} w_0\left(e^{-\epsilon*}\epsilon*+e^{-\epsilon*}-e^{-2\sigma}\right)\frac{1}{2\sigma}\\
   &=\frac{b(b+1)(2b+1)}{6} w_0 \left( e^{-2\sigma\frac{P_c}{b}}\left(2\sigma\frac{P_c}{b} + 1\right) - e^{-2\sigma}\right)
\end{align}

The correction is indeed in the correct area, as can be seen here:
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{BANDED_ERH}
\caption{This is a plot of $D_\textrm{ERH}/D_0$, with $P_c=1$}
\end{figure}

But I could not yet find a perfect fit for $P_c$. As an example I plot here $D/D_0$ for $b=21$, together with some options for $P_c$, but none match good enough:
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{b21}
\caption{This is a plot of $D/D_0$, using the fitting method, together with $D_\textrm{ERH}$ for several options of $P_c$.}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
