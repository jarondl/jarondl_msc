\sect{Introduction}

These are research notes regarding several aspects of random matrix spectrum,
in particular for banded matrices.

Our questions are what are the implications of several properties on the 
spectrum, and in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item   If the disorder matrix is conservative (all row sums equal), 
        we have an ergodic mode , with $PN=N$. What about eigenmodes with
        eigenvalues close to the ergodic mode? can we predict their $PN$?
\item   If all matrix elements are positive, and the matrix is conservative,
        the eigenvalues are all positive, and the ergodic mode
        is at the edge of the spectrum. What if matrix elements are negative?
        where will the ergodic mode be? What is the meaning of a wide
        mode not in the minimal $\lambda$?
\item   What is the difference between diagonal disorder and banded disorder?
\item   How can we estimate the band position and $PN(\lambda)$, perhaps 
        with Anderson localization, and Thouless' formula?
\item   In the analysis of banded matrices, each $\lambda$ has more than 
        one or two corresponding velocities. Which velocity should we use?
\item   What about sparsity? In $1d$, sparsity makes the difference between
        diffusion and sub diffusion, because of percolative effects.
        What is the case for banded matrix?
        One assumption could be that banded disorder is similar
        to regular disorder with $s = b$.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Model}

We wish to study a banded model similar to the one presented in \cite{bodyfelt_scaling_2013},
starting with an ordered (and periodic) matrix:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:ordered}
w_{nm} &= \begin{cases}
  w_0 &\qquad \textrm{ if  } \quad 0<|n-m|\le b \\
  0 &\qquad \textrm{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
%
According to Bloch's theorem, the eigenvectors of translational invariant
matrices are plane waves, and their eigenvalues can be easily deduced:
\begin{align}
k\ \  &=\ \  \frac{\pi m}{N} \ \ \ \ \ m=1..N \\
\vec{V}_k\ \  &=\ \  \cos(k\cdot x)\\
\lambda_k\ \  &=\ \  \sum_{n=1..b} 2\cos(n\cdot k) \\
&= \ \ -1 + \frac{\sin((b+\dfrac{1}{2})k)}{\sin(\dfrac{1}{2}k)}
\end{align}  
Where in the last step we have used one of Lagrange's trigonometric identities. 
The lower bound of $\lambda_k$ is $-2b$. 
$\lambda_k$ for several values of $b$ is plotted in \autoref{fig:theor_banded_ev}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics{pta_theor_banded_ev}
    \caption{$\lambda(k)$ for banded ordered matrices. Both plots
    represent the same curves, but in the left one there is a $+2b$ shift, both for clarity 
    and for later usage in conservative matrices. Since our 
    models are periodic, only the left half ($0,\pi$) of each plot is relevant. Since 
    the tangent is $DOS^{-1}$, the points with tangent zero are $DOS$ divergences.
    }
    \label{fig:theor_banded_ev}
\end{figure}



A cosine plane wave will have $PN= \frac{2}{3}N$. We can also compute the mode velocity:
\begin{align}
v \ \ &=\ \ \frac{d\lambda_k}{dk} \ \ =\ \ -\sum_{n=1..b} 2\cdot n\cdot \sin(n\cdot k)
\end{align}
Note that this expression is {\bf not single valued}. Meaning that each $\lambda$ 
has more than one associated velocity. 


The $DOS$ is defined by $\frac{dk}{d\lambda_k}$, which is the inverse of the 
velocity. Since density is additive, for each $\lambda$ we add the densities
of all relevant $k$ modes. For the moment we use a numerical solution to
find those $k$s. In \autoref{fig:dos} we plot the velocities and inverse 
$DOS$ as a function of $\lambda$.

             The inverse $DOS$ will always be less then the velocity. 
             We see large $DOS$ (small inverse) at energies where a single
             mode $DOS$ is diverging, and where we have more than one $k$.}

\sect{Adding disorder - finite localization}

The ordered lattice had no localization - all the $PN$ where equal to $\frac{2}{3}N$.
To study localization, we add to the ordered matrix $W_0$ a disordered matrix $V$:
%\renewcommand*{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}
\begin{align}
W \ = \ W_0 \ + \ V
\end{align}
%
$W_0$ is the same banded matrix as before, with two parameters: $N$ and $b$.

$V$ is parametrized by a disorder parameter $\eta$, its own bandwidth $\tilde{b}$ 
(which can be different from $b$), and its conservativity. Later we
shall want to introduce a sparsity parameter $s$. 


The first kind of $V$ we examine has a uniformly distributed diagonal disorder:
\begin{align}
\gamma_n  \ = \  w_{nn} \ \in \ \left[-\frac{\eta}{2},+\frac{\eta}{2} \right]
\end{align}
{This disorder is not limited to positive elements},
which means that the spectrum is not bound.


This disorder, as small as it may be, will cause finite Anderson localization.
According to FGR, the transition rate (or the inverse of mean-free-time) is
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{t_\ell} = \varrho \langle w_{nm}^2\rangle
\end{align}
Where $\varrho$ is the Density-Of-States, and $w_{nm}$ is a rate between
neighboring sites.
To get the mean-free-path, we need to translate this to units of distance:
\begin{align}
\ell = v_\lambda t_\ell = \frac{v_\lambda}{\varrho \langle w_{nm}^2\rangle}
\end{align}
As mentioned before, the problem is that $v_\lambda$ is not single valued,
so we do not know yet what should be put there. If we put the inverse of 
the DOS, we get the expression:
\begin{align}
\ell = \frac{\varrho^{-2}}{ \langle w_{nm}^2\rangle}
\end{align}
We plot this result as a solid line in the next figures, with $<w^2> = \eta^2/3$.
On the eigenvalue axis, it does tell us about eigenvalues with low $PN$,
and the span (or band) where eigenvlaues exist. This does not scale with $N$, although 
the numerics seem to do so \autoref{fig:anderson_byN}

    no $PN$ is higher than the plane waves' $PN =2/3 N$. We can also explain
    points with low $PN$ by the corresponding $DOS$, and the band of eigenvalues. 
    Notice that there are eigenvalues below $-2b$. Also, there is a small unexplained bulge around $\lambda=1$.
    Compare this to figure 2 of \cite{bodyfelt_scaling_2013}.\protect\footnotemark Bottom right: cummulative distribution

\footnotetext{The 
    differences are that there the basic matrix (before disorder) had a 'conserving' diagonal of $-2b$,
    which corresponds to a horizontal shift, the $x$-axis there is $\sqrt{\lambda}$,
    the disorder is over the main $2b+1$ diagonal instead of only the main diagonal, 
    and the disorder is larger, $\eta=0.5$.}

    Here we see the scaling in $N$ of the $PN$ values. The $PN$ of the 
    larger left portion scales as expected by $2/3 N$. In 
    \cite{bodyfelt_scaling_2013} this appears as the $PN>0.6N$ definition 
    of "extended modes". For this kind of disorder the other portion
    also scales in $N$, but less strongly. We assume that for a large enough
    $N$ the shape will converge to \autoref{fig:dos}, but that our sample
    size is not enough to show that fact. }

\sect{Banded disorder}

To study conservation we need a different $V$.
We define it as a random banded matrix similar to the definition of $W_0$:
\begin{align}
v_{nm} &= \begin{cases}
  w_0 \left[-\frac{\eta}{2},+\frac{\eta}{2} \right]&\qquad \textrm{ if  } \quad 0<|n-m|\le \tilde{b} \\
  0 &\qquad \textrm{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Again, this is not limited to positive elements. Also, we believe it is 
important for $V$ to average to $0$, otherwise there is an eigenvalue shift 
arising from the disorder. It is not clear what the importance of $\tilde{b}$
is. The usual inclination is to set $\tilde{b}=b$, but one can ask
whether this is equal to raising $\eta$, or perhaps there is new
physics arriving from a different scattering matrix.

        The solid line is the theoretical $PN$ as explained earlier. The
        blue dots seem closer to the theory, and higher $\tilde{b}$ corresponds 
        to lower $PN$, the same effect as in higher $\eta$. Also note the horizontal
        broadening of the bands, particularly for high $\tilde{b}$.}

\sect{Conservation}

If the sum of all the rows in $V$ is $0$, we will always have an ergodic mode
at $\lambda=-2b$, with $PN=N$. Also, several other modes in the close 
area are also wide, probably with $PN< \frac{2}{3} N$. We do not know yet 
what is the expected $PN$ for these modes, apart from the weak disorder limit,
where all the $PN$ for $\lambda$ around $-2b$ have $PN=\frac{2}{3}$.

We have plotted results for regular and conservative models in \autoref{fig:cons}

     Top and bottom left are regular, middle and bottom right are conservative. Note that
     the disorder is many times stronger than the original ordered matrix,
     rendering our previous analysis moot. However, the hallmark of
     conservation, a peak at $\lambda=-2b$, is still very much evident. It seems 
     that in the conserving model the band is broader, but perhaps this is
     because another difference. The regular model has 1 random off-diagonal ($+1$),
     and one that is decided by symmetry ($-1$), the diagonal itself is zero. The conservative model also
     has the diagonal pre-decided, different from zero. This adds to the matrix magnitude.}
