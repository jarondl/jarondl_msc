\sect{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Model}

The model is a $1d$ chain, with constant hopping and random site energies.
In site representation, 
where $\kket{n}$ is site number $n$, the Hamiltonian is:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{H} \ &= \ \sum_n^N \kket{n}\bbra{n} \varepsilon_n \ + \ \kket{n}\bbra{n+1}c \\
    c  \ &= \ 1 \\
    \varepsilon_n \ &\in \ \left[-\frac{W}{2} \ ,\  +\frac{W}{2} \right]
\end{align}
${c}$ is a constant that sets the energy scale, 
and $\varepsilon_n$ is a random variable 
\textbf{uniformly} distributed on the stated range. 
The free parameters are therefore ${W}$ and ${N}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Localization length}

The modes are localized, with localization length $\xi$. The more commonly used parameter is the corresponding Lyapunov exponent ${\gamma = \xi^{-1}}$. Strictly speaking, this is the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit of $\gamma_N$. Anyway, the known result
for this speccific model in the weak disorder limit is
\begin{align*}
    \gamma(E)  \ &= \ \frac{\left\langle \varepsilon^2\right\rangle}{2\cdot\left(4\cdot c^2 -E^2\right)} \ = \ \frac{W^2}{24\cdot\left(4\cdot c^2 -E^2\right)}
\end{align*}

\subsect{S - matrix}

In this formalism, we attach one tight-binding lead to site $1$, and another to site $N$, with coupling $\Gamma$. 
Solving for the leads, we end with a transmission matrix :
\begin{align}
T \  &= \  \left\langle 1 \right |\frac{\Gamma v}{E-\mathcal{H}_{0} -(\Gamma/2)(E-iv)Q^\dagger Q}\left|N\right\rangle\\
Q^\dagger Q \ &=\ \kket{1}\bbra{1} + \kket{N}\bbra{N} \\
g(E,v)  \ &= \  T^2 
\end{align}
With ${E}$ and ${v}$ being the energy and velocity of
the lead modes. From now on we assume ${\Gamma =1 }$. In this case the energy and velocity are:
\begin{align}
    E \ = \ -2c\cdot\cos(k) 
    \qquad v  \ = \ 2c\cdot\sin(k) 
\end{align}
\rmrk{This $c$ is actually of the leads right? and 
$k$ is quantized by the lead length?}

The numerical calculation of this transmission is done
by built-in numerical inversion of the matrix.

\subsect{The diagonal approximation}

The diagonal approximation involves two steps. The
first is using only the diagonal parts of $Q^\dagger Q$ in the basis that diagonalizes $\mathcal{H}_0$. 
The second step is to sum squared absolute values instead
of first summing up and then squaring.

Denoting the $\alpha$ eigenmode of $\mathcal{H}_0$ by $\psi^\alpha_n$, with energy $\lambda_\alpha$, the expression we calculate is:
\begin{align}
g_h \ = \    \sum_\alpha \left| \frac{\psi_1^\alpha\psi_N^\alpha \Gamma v}{E-\lambda_\alpha - \frac{\Gamma}{2}(E-iv)\cdot\left(|\psi_1^\alpha|^2+|\psi_N^\alpha|^2\right)}  \right|^2
\end{align}
