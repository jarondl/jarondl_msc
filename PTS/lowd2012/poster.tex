Motivated by \cite{alexander,amir,kbd}, we consider 1D, quasi-1D or 2D networks with:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dp_n}{dt} \quad=\quad \sum_m w_{nm} p_m
\end{align*}
The random site model ($1D$ / $2D$ ) : %\cite{amir}:
\begin{align*}
w_{nm} \quad&=\quad  w_0\eexp{-\epsilon_{nm}}\eexp{-|x_n-x_m|/\xi}  \\
x_n \quad&=\quad \mbox{random with avg. distance $r_0$}\\
s \quad&\equiv\quad \xi/r_0\\
\epsilon_{nm} \quad&=\quad \mbox{random activation potential} \in [0,\sigma] 
\end{align*}
%
The banded lattice model (quasi-$1D$ ) : %\cite{kbd}:
%
\begin{align*}
w_{nm}  \quad&=\quad   w_0  \eexp{-\epsilon_{nm}}  B(n-m) \\
b \quad&=\quad \mbox{"bandwidth"} = \mbox{width of }\  B(r)
\end{align*}

The long time dynamics are characterized by the spreading $S(t)$, the survival probability $\mathcal{P}(t)$ and the spectral counting function $\mathcal{N}(\lambda)$. In the case of diffusion these are:
\begin{align*}
S(t) \quad&=\quad  (2d)Dt\ \\
\mathcal{P}(t) \quad &= \quad  \frac{1}{\left({4\pi D t}\right)^{d/2}} \\
\mathcal{N}(\lambda)  \quad&\propto\quad \left[\frac{\lambda}{D}\right]^{d/2} 
\end{align*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{The $1D$ chain model}{name=chain,column=0,below=diffusion}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{} With only nearest neighbour transitions, we get for $s>1$:
\begin{align*}
D = D[w_n] = \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_n \frac{1}{w_n} \right)^{-1} 
 =  \frac{s-1}{s} \, w_0
\end{align*}
For $0<s<1$, we have subdiffusion ($D=0$) with:
\begin{align*}
S(t) \ \ &\propto \ \ t^{2s/(1+s)}   \\ 
\mathcal{P}(t) \ \ &\propto \ \ t^{-s/(1+s)}
\end{align*}
 These are exact analytic results, based on work by Shlomo Alexander\cite{alexander}, and they are summed up in panel (a) of figure \ref{fig:alexander}.

According to linear response:
\[ D[\bm{w}] =  \frac{1}{2d}\iint w(r,\epsilon)  r^2   \rho(r,\epsilon) d\epsilon dr\]
However, this will not work for "sparse" systems, because only percolating 
paths contribute to the transport. We define a percolation threshold by :
\[
\iint_{w(r,\epsilon)>w*} \rho(r,\epsilon)drd\epsilon  =  p_c
\]
with $p_c$ of order unity.

Then we calculate $D$ as follows:
\[
D_{\tbox{ERH}}[\bm{w}]  = \frac{1}{2d}\iint \min\{w(r,\epsilon),w^*\}  r^2   \rho(r,\epsilon) d\epsilon dr
\]
