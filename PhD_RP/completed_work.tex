\chapter{Completed Work}

% Use drawings and slides from the theory lunch (actual and prelim talk)

% Also anything I have in the notes which is worthy.
% For example distance statisics. If I did not conrtibute, should be in the Appendix.
% Half cooked ideas..

\section{The ERH procedure}

The diffusion coefficient is defined by the dependence
of the variance in time:
%
\begin{align}
\textrm{Var}(n) \quad =\quad 2d\ D\ t
\end{align}
%
Within the transient diffusion stage,
assuming we start at a specific node $n$, the variance after time
$t$ will be
%
\begin{align}
\textrm{Var}(n) = \sum_m w_{nm} t (x_m-x_n)^2
\end{align}
Therefore, the diffusion coefficient for evolution 
starting at node $n$ is
%
\begin{align}
D_n \quad=\quad \frac{1}{2d}\sum_m (x_m-x_n)^2 w_{nm}
\end{align}
%
Averaging over the starting node, and converting the sum to an integral,
we have
%
\begin{align}
D_{\tbox{linear}}  \ \ = \ \ \frac{1}{2d}\iint w(r,\epsilon) \ r^2  \ \rho(r,\epsilon) \ d\epsilon dr 
\end{align}
