My MSc files
------------

This repo holds the history of my Physics MSc at BGU. It is actually a public
backup, not of interest to anyone except me.

It used to be a `bzr` repo, and was converted to git lately. The idea was to
track history and to have a reliable way to sync my different identities: my
university desktop, my personal desktop, and my laptop, even when I'm on the
train. Therefore, the commits are not always complete, many of the comments
are obscure or meaningless, and no editing was done.

So if you are not [Yaron de Leeuw](https://jarondl.net/), you are probably in
the wrong place.
