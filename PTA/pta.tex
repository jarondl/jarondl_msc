\sect{Model}

A periodic banded logbox model. The band profile is flat ($\Theta(b)$).
The off diagonal elements are log-box:
%
\begin{align}
w_{nm} &= w_0 \eexp{-\epsilon} \\
\epsilon &\in \textrm{uniform  } [0,2\sigma]
\end{align}
%
The diagonal elements are set so that each row's sum will be zero.
%
\begin{align}
w_{nn} = -\sum_{m\ne n} w_{nm}  
\end{align}

\sect{PN plots}

We have produced several plots of PN vs $\lambda$. For low-sparsity, there is an 
agreement with the two "windows" observation. (For very low sparsity there are even hints
of three windows). It seems that the effect of sparsity is to shorten the more extended window,
up to a point where very few modes are extended (remember that the special $\lambda=0$ is always fully extended).

\sect{The effects of pinning}

By pinning we mean adding some elements to the diagonal,
that represent a spring attaching a ball to a fixed origin.


We used a uniform distribution on the range $[-0.3,0]$,
in order to discern the effect.


It seems that the only difference is some localization in
the low-eigenvalues. The lowest modes are replaced with less 
extended modes with higher eigenvalues. Note that the $\lambda=0$ mode no longer
exist. To highlight the low eigenvalues,
we have used log-scale for the $\lambda$ axis.

\sect{Thouless conductance}

Extended modes are more sensitive to boundary conditions. To measure
the effect quantitivly, we've used Thouless' method of adding
a phase to the boundary condition, and measuring the change in the eigenvalues.

We define $\lambda_0$ as the eigenvalue with regular periodic boundary conditions,
and $\lambda_\phi$ as the eigenvalue after applying a phase of $\phi$ to the boundary conditions.
Then $g$ is defined as
%
\begin{align}
  g = \frac{|\lambda_\phi - \lambda_0 |}{\phi^2}\ \times \ \frac{1}{\Delta}
\end{align}
%
Where $\Delta\ =\ \lambda_{n+1}-\lambda_n$ is the level spacing. 
In practice, we have averaged over five 
neighboring spacings to avoid artifacts.


The resulting $g(\lambda)$ is strikingly similar to the $PN(\lambda)$ results,
but the change is much stronger (note the logarithmic $y$-scale).

\sect{Non positive matrices}


In the RP we have claimed that the positivity of the matrix
causes the very wide modes to be on the lower edge of the spectrum.
To see this point, we ran numerics with $N=1000$ $b=5$ and $\sigma=0.1$, where 
we multiplied elements randomly (albeit symmetrically) by $\pm 1$. 
It seems that without positivity the left "plateau" disappears, although
the $\lambda=0$ mode stays. Also notice the arc-like feature on the right,
it was there previously, but it is more pronounced for $\sigma=0.1$.  
Also, our numerical calculation of Thouless' conductance seems to
fail completely for the non positive matrices.
