	abstract = {The calculation of the heating rate of cold atoms in vibrating traps requires a theory that goes beyond the Kubo linear response formulation. If a strong "quantum chaos" assumption does not hold, the analysis of transitions shows similarities with a percolation problem in energy space. We show how the texture and the sparsity of the perturbation matrix, as determined by the geometry of the system, dictate the result. An improved sparse random matrix model is introduced: it captures the essential ingredients of the problem, and leads to a generalized variable range hopping picture.},

	abstract = "We study a microscopic mean-field model for the dynamics of the electron glass, near a local equilibrium state. Phonon-induced tunneling processes are responsible for generating transitions between localized electronic sites, which eventually lead to the thermalization of the system. We find that the decay of an excited state to a locally stable state is far from being exponential in time, and does not have a characteristic time scale. Working in a mean-field approximation, we write rate equations for the average occupation numbers, and describe the return to the locally stable state using the eigenvalues of a rate matrix, A, describing the linearized time-evolution of the occupation numbers. Analyzing the probability distribution of the eigenvalues of A we find that, under certain physically reasonable assumptions, it takes the form $P(\lambda) \sim \frac{1}{|\lambda|}$, leading naturally to a logarithmic decay in time. While our derivation of the matrix A is specific for the chosen model, we expect that other glassy systems, with different microscopic characteristics, will be described by random rate matrices belonging to the same universality class of A. Namely, the rate matrix has elements with a very broad distribution, i.e., exponentials of a variable with nearly uniform distribution.",

This model arises naturally in various physical contexts, such as the diffusion of particles, slow relaxations in glasses, and scalar phonon localization. Using a combination of a renormalization group procedure and a direct moment calculation, we find the eigenvalue distribution density (i.e., the spectrum) and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, for arbitrary dimension. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of the results.",

	abstract = "Semi-linear response theory determines the absorption coefficient of a driven system using a resistor network calculation: Each unperturbed energy level of a particle in a vibrating trap, or of an electron in a mesoscopic ring, is regarded as a node ($n$) of the network; The transition rates ($w_{mn}$) between the nodes are regarded as the elements of a random matrix that describes the network. If the size-distribution of the connecting elements is wide (e.g. log-normal-like rather than Gaussian-like) the result for the absorption coefficient differs enormously from the conventional Kubo prediction of linear response theory. We use a generalized variable range hopping scheme for the analysis. In particular we apply this approach to obtain practical approximations for the conductance of mesoscopic rings. In this context Mott's picture of diffusion and localization is revisited.",
