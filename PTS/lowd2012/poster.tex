We consider 1D or 2D network systems whose dynamics is described
by a rate equation, with transitions rates $w_{nm}$ that form a symmetric matrix.
In particular (but no exclusively) we are interested
in a model where 
\beq
  w_{nm}\propto \exp(|x_n-x_m|/\xi)
\eeq
We characterize such a system by a sparsity parameter~$s$
that reflects the connectivity of the network. For the above case, $s=\xi/r_0$.

The diffusion coefficient $D$ characterizes the
long time dynamics of a spreading distribution.
In 1D $D$ can display an abrupt percolation-like
transition from diffusive (${D>0}$) to sub-diffusive (${D=0}$)
behavior at ${s < s_c}$ (in our case ${s=1}$).  
The question arises whether such a transition happens also in
higher dimensions.

$D$ may be deduced  from spectral properties,
or via a resistor network calculation.
The extension of the resistor network method to wide distributions, leads to a generalized Variable Range Hopping (VRH) strategy.
In what follows we pursue the same direction and obtain an
improved Effective Range Hopping (ERH) estimate for~$D$.
Using this approach we show that in the 2D case, as $s$ becomes small,
the functional $D[\bm{w}]$ exhibits a smooth crossover from LRT behavior 
to semi-linear VRH-like dependence.

  \headerbox{The $1d$ chain model}{name=lrt,column=0,below=diffusion}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{} In the $1d$ chain model, the location of each site has a uniform random distribution on a $1d$ line.

The rates are calculated according to $w_{nm} = w_0 \exp(-|r_m-r_n|/\xi)$, with only nearest neighbor transitions
($b=1$). We can convert the spacing distribution to rate distribution, and, making the analogy with adding connectors in series, we obtain:
\beq
D = D[w_n] = \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_n \frac{1}{w_n} \right)^{-1} 
 =  \frac{s-1}{s} \, w_0
\eeq
for $s>1$, with $s=\xi/r_0$. For $0<s<1$, there is a sub diffusive regime, where the survival probability and spreading are:
\beq
S(t) \ \ &\propto& \ \ t^{2s/(1+s)}   \\ 
\mathcal{P}(t) \ \ &\propto& \ \ t^{-s/(1+s)}
\eeq
 These are exact analytic results, based on work by Shlomo Alexander\cite{alexander}, and they are summed up in panel (a) of figure \ref{fig:alexander}.

It shows a sub-diffusive regime where $0<s<1$, and a diffusive regime for $s>1$. The red line is of the diffusion coefficient $D$, which is zero for the sub-diffusive regime $s<1$. It is dimensionless as we set $r_0=1$. In the $2d$ plot, on the right, we see the diffusion coefficient, numerical fit results vs ERH, as explained in sections \ref{sec:diff2d} and \ref{sec:num_d_2d}. The $Y$ axis is $D$ in logarithmic scale, while the $X$ axis is $X=-1/s$. The dots are numerical fit results, extracted from plots such as \ref{fig:exp_2d_D_vs_subD}. The dashed line is of the LRT result, and the solid line is the ERH result with $p_c = 5$.}

  \headerbox{Linear response}{name=lrt,column=1,below=alexander}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If we had an ordered lattice, then the exact result for $D$ would be 
%
\beq
D  =  D_{\tbox{LRT}}[\bm{w}]   =  \frac{1}{2d}\iint w(r,\epsilon) \ r^2  \ \rho(r,\epsilon) \ d\epsilon dr 
\eeq
%
This expression is strictly {\em linear}.
For the infinite temperature variation of 2D random site model we get  
%
\beq
D \ \ = \ \ 3\pi \, s^4 \, w_0
\eeq
%
This expression will not work for ${s<1}$ because sparse contribution 
of strongly coupled sites do not contribute to the transport. 
Only percolating trajectories do have a contribution. We are therefore urged 
to introduce approximation schemes that takes this connectivity 
issue into account.

  \headerbox{Spectral Analysis}{name=spect,column=2,below=alexander}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In a diffusive system the coarse grained spreading 
is described by the standard diffusion equation,
with an evolving Gaussian distribution  
%  
\beq
\rho(x;t) \ \ = \ \ \prod_{i=1}^d \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma(t)} 
\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x_i}{\sigma(t)}\right)^2 \right]
\eeq
%
where $\sigma^2=2Dt$. It follows from this expression that 
% 
\beq
S(t) \ \ = \ \ \left\langle r^2(t) \right\rangle  \ \ = \ \ (2d)Dt
\eeq
%
and 
%
\beq
\mathcal{P}(t) \quad \approx \quad  \frac{1}{\left({4\pi D t}\right)^{d/2}} 
\qquad\qquad[r_0^d=1]
\eeq
%
The eignevalues of the diffusion equation are $\lambda=Dq^2$ 
where the possible values of the momentum are determined  
by the periodic boundary conditions as $q=(2\pi/L)\vec{n}$. 
It follows that the cumulative number of eigenstates is  
%
\beq \label{eq:expected_D_2d}
\mathcal{N}(\lambda) \ \ = \ \ 
\int_0^\lambda g(\lambda')d\lambda' \quad 
= \quad \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^d
\frac{\Omega_d}{d}
\left[\frac{\lambda}{D}\right]^{d/2}
\eeq



It is well known that the survival probability 
is related to the eigenvalues of $\bm{w}$ through the relation
%
\beq \label{eq:survival}
\mathcal{P}(t) \ \ = \ \ \frac{1}{N}\sum_\lambda \eexp{\lambda t} \ \ \equiv \ \ \int_0^{\infty} g(\lambda)d\lambda \ \eexp{\lambda t}
\eeq
%
For a diffusive system one can verify that the 
indeed the expressions above 
for $g(\lambda)$ and $\mathcal{P}(t)$ 
are related by a Laplace transform.  
%
More generally, it follows that $D$ can be deduced from 
the asymptotic behavior of $g(\lambda)$
in the ${\lambda\rightarrow 0}$ limit  
where the diffusive description is valid.
%
In contrast to that for large $\lambda$ we expect $g(\lambda)$ to coincide 
with the distribution of the decay rates $\gamma_n=\sum_{m}w_{mn}$, 
reflecting localized modes.

 The dots represent numerical diagonalization. The dashed lines are the expected diffusion results according to \eqref{eq:expected_D_2d}, with $D$ as a fit parameter. The solid lines are according to Ariel's result, as presented in \eqref{eq:amir_expected} . There is a striking difference between the $1d$ and $2d$ cases. For $1d$, the slope for sparse models ($s<1$) is less than $\frac{1}{2}$, meaning we have sub-diffusion. In the $2d$ case, the low-$\lambda$ slope is always $1$, which correspondes to normal diffusion.} \label{fig:exp_2d_D_vs_subD}
