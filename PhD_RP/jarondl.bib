	abstract = {A general type of fluctuation-dissipation theorem is discussed to show that the physical quantities such as complex susceptibility of magnetic or electric polarization and complex conductivity for electric conduction are rigorously expressed in terms of time-fluctuation of dynamical variables associated with such irreversible processes. This is a generalization of statistical mechanics which affords exact formulation as the basis of calculation of such irreversible quantities from atomistic theory. The general formalism of this statistical-mechanical theory is examined in detail. The response, relaxation, and correlation functions are defined in quantummechanical way and their relations are investigated. The formalism is illustrated by simple examples of magnetic and conduction problems. Certain sum rules are discussed for these examples. Finally it is pointed out that this theory may be looked as a generalization of the Einstein relation.©1957 The Physical Society of Japan},

	abstract = {We consider random networks whose dynamics is described by a rate equation, with transition rates \$w\_\{nm\}\$ that form a symmetric matrix. The long time evolution of the system is characterized by a diffusion coefficient {\$D\$.} In one dimension it is well known that {\$D\$} can display an abrupt percolation-like transition from diffusion ({\$D{\textgreater}0\$)} to sub-diffusion (D=0). A question arises whether such a transition happens in higher dimensions. Numerically {\$D\$} can be evaluated using a resistor network calculation, or optionally it can be deduced from the spectral properties of the system. Contrary to a recent expectation that is based on a renormalization-group analysis, we deduce that {\$D\$} is finite; suggest an "effective-range-hopping" procedure to evaluate it; and contrast the results with the linear estimate. The same approach is useful for the analysis of networks that are described by quasi-one-dimensional sparse banded matrices.},

Several physical consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some special cases exact solutions are calculated.

Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed.},

One possibility is that a pure quantum state corresponds directly to reality. However, there is a long history of suggestions that a quantum state (even a pure state) represents only knowledge or information about some aspect of reality. Here we show that any model in which a quantum state represents mere information about an underlying physical state of the system, and in which systems that are prepared independently have independent physical states, must make predictions that contradict those of quantum theory.},

The covariance matrix of this Gaussian is found explicitly for a linear chain with nearest‐neighbor forces in contact at its ends with heat reservoirs at temperatures T1 and {TN}, N being the number of oscillators. We also find explicitly the covariance matrix, but not the distribution, for the case where the interaction between the system and the reservoirs is represented by very ``hard'' collisions. This matrix differs from that for the previous case only by a trivial factor. The heat flux in the stationary state is found, as expected, to be proportional to the temperature difference (T1 − {TN)} rather than to the temperature gradient (T1 − {TN)∕N.} The kinetic temperature of the jth oscillator T(j) behaves, however, in an unexpected fashion. T(j) is essentially constant in the interior of the chain decreasing exponentially in the direction of the hotter reservoir rising only at the end oscillator in contact with that reservoir (with corresponding behavior at the other end of the chain). No explanation is offered for this paradoxical result.},

In the last few years, important steps have been made toward understanding the qualitatively new critical phenomena in complex networks. The results, concepts, and methods of this rapidly developing field are reviewed. Two closely related classes of these critical phenomena are considered, namely, structural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in cooperative models on networks as substrates. Systems where a network and interacting agents on it influence each other are also discussed. A wide range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation, phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks are mentioned. Strong finite-size effects in these systems and open problems and perspectives are also discussed.},

	abstract = {In mammals, mitochondria and mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA)} are transmitted through the female germ line. Mature oocytes contain at least 100,000 copies of {mtDNA}, organized at 1–2 copies per organelle. Despite the high genome copy number, {mtDNA} sequence variants are observed to segregate rapidly between generations, and this has led to the concept of a developmental bottleneck for the transmission of {mtDNA.} Ultrastructural investigations of primordial germ cells show that they contain approximately 10 mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial biogenesis is arrested during early embryogenesis, and that the mitochondria contributing to the germ cell precursors are simply apportioned from those present in the zygote. Thus, as few as 0.01\% of the mitochondria in the oocyte actually contribute to the offspring of the next generation. Mitochondrial replication restarts in the migrating primordial germ cells, and mitochondrial numbers steadily increase to a few thousand in primordial oocytes. Genetic evidence from both heteroplasmic mice and human pedigrees suggests that segregation of {mtDNA} sequence variants is largely a stochastic process that occurs during the mitotic divisions of the germ cell precursors. This process is essentially complete by the time the primary oocyte population is differentiated in fetal life. Analysis of the distribution of pathogenic {mtDNA} mutations in the offspring of carrier mothers shows that risk of inheriting a pathogenic mutation increases with the proportion in the mother, but there is no bias toward transmitting more or less of the mutant {mtDNAs.} This implies that there is no strong selection against oocytes carrying pathogenic mutations and that atresia is not a filter for oocyte quality based on oxidative phosphorylation capacity. The large number of mitochondria and {mtDNAs} present in the oocyte may simply represent a genetic mechanism to ensure their distribution to the gametes and somatic cells of the next generation. If true, {mtDNA} copy number, and by inference mitochondrial number, may be the most important determinant of oocyte quality, not because of the effects on oocyte metabolism, but because too few would result in a maldistribution in the early embryo. © 2007, Elsevier Inc.},

Moreover the location of the nodes may be {random.The} question that we resolve is: How many neighbors should each node be connected to in order that the overall network is connected in a multi-hop fashion? We show that in a network with n randomly placed nodes, each node should be connected to Θ(log n) nearest neighbors. If each node is connected to less than 0.074 log n nearest neighbors then the network is asymptotically disconnected with probability one as n increases, while if each node is connected to more than 5.1774 log n nearest neighbors then the network is asymptotically connected with probability approaching one as n increases. It appears that the critical constant may be close to one, but that remains an open {problem.These} results should be contrasted with some works in the 1970s and 1980s which suggested that the "magic number" of nearest neighbors should be six or eight.},

The chain is bounded by two stochastic heat reservoirs, one hot and one cold. The Fourier conductivity of the chain decreases smoothly to a finite large-system limit. Special treatment of satellite collisions with the stochastic boundaries is required to obtain Lyapunov spectra. The summed spectra are negative, and correspond to a relatively small contraction in phase space, with the formation of a multifractal strange attractor. The largest of the Lyapunov exponents for the ding-a-ling chain appears to converge to a limiting value with increasing chain length, so that the large-system Lyapunov spectrum has a finite limit.},

Mapping the problem onto a nonlinear σ model with nonlocal interaction, we find a transition from localized to extended states at α=1. At this critical value of α the system exhibits multifractality and spectral statistics intermediate between the Wigner-Dyson and Poisson statistics. These features are reminiscent of those typical of the mobility edge of disordered conductors. We find a continuous set of critical theories at α=1, parametrized by the value of the coupling constant of the σ model. At α{\textgreater}1 all states are expected to be localized with integrable power-law tails. At the same time, for 1{\textless}α{\textless}3/2 the wave packet spreading at a short time scale is superdiffusive: 〈{\textbar}r{\textbar}〉∼t1/(2α-1), which leads to a modification of the Altshuler-Shklovskii behavior of the spectral correlation function. At 1/2{\textless}α{\textless}1 the statistical properties of eigenstates are similar to those in a metallic sample in d=(α-1/2)-1 dimensions. Finally, the region α{\textless}1/2 is equivalent to the corresponding Gaussian ensemble of random matrices (α=0).

The particles are confined in a one-dimensional box with fixed ends coupled to heat reservoirs at different temperatures. The study aims to throw light upon recent controversial results on thermal conductivity in one-dimensional systems. When the particles interact through elastic hard-point collisions (a standard asymmetric case), the system is shown to have always infinite (anomalous) thermal conductivity as follows from the Prosen-Campbell theorem.},

Ample numerical evidence is provided through an exact diagonalization of several large-size Hamiltonians. The predictions of the Thouless formula, whose evaluation only needs the eigenvalues, are critically checked against the inverse participation ratio ({IPR)} of the corresponding eigenvectors. Included are the Lloyd model (for sufficiently low disorder mobility edges cannot be excluded) and surprising, new results on the binary alloy problem.

In particular, as P(k)∼k-γ, ρ(λ)∼{\textbar}λ{\textbar}1-2γ. We propose a simple approximation, which enables us to calculate spectra of various graphs analytically.

Phonon-induced tunneling processes are responsible for generating transitions between localized electronic sites, which eventually lead to the thermalization of the system. We find that the decay of an excited state to a locally stable state is far from being exponential in time and does not have a characteristic time scale. Working in a mean-field approximation, we write rate equations for the average occupation numbers ⟨ni⟩ and describe the return to the locally stable state by using the eigenvalues of a rate matrix A describing the linearized time evolution of the occupation numbers. By analyzing the probability distribution P(λ) of the eigenvalues of A , we find that, under certain physically reasonable assumptions, it takes the form P(λ)˜(1)/(∣λ∣) , leading naturally to a logarithmic decay in time. While our derivation of the matrix A is specific for the chosen model, we expect that other glassy systems, with different microscopic characteristics, will be described by random rate matrices belonging to the same universality class of A . Namely, the rate matrix has elements with a very broad distribution, as in the case of exponentials of a variable with nearly uniform distribution.},

We study the case of ‘‘dynamic’’ disorder whereby the random environment is renewed at each successive jump of the hopping particle, and also the case of ‘‘static’’ disorder with frozen randomly distributed barriers. The transition characteristics are governed by Boltzmann statistics. We employ standard Monte Carlo techniques to monitor properties such as the mean-square displacement. The trends of the motion are shown to include local trapping at early times, allowing for the search of a crossover time to the conventional diffusive regime, {〈R2〉∼t}, as a function of temperature. We find that the crossover time versus temperature dependence is of the Arrhenius type determined by an effective activation energy barrier for percolation in the case of static disorder. For a uniform distribution of the barriers, this activation barrier is shown to coincide with the threshold concentration for bond percolation, as simple arguments suggest. We also demonstrate that an increase in the degree of dynamic disorder leads to an increase in the particle mobility. Some relationships of the present model to several experimental systems are discussed.},

As an example we consider cold atoms in a nearly integrable optical billiard with a displaceable wall (piston). The motion is completely chaotic but with a small Lyapunov exponent. The Hamiltonian matrix does not look like one taken from a Gaussian ensemble, but rather it is very sparse and textured. This can be characterized by parameters s and g which reflect the percentage of large elements and their connectivity, respectively. For g we use a resistor network calculation that has a direct relation to the semilinear response characteristics of the system, hence leading to a prediction regarding the energy absorption rate of cold atoms in optical billiards with vibrating walls.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show how existing scientific software can be parallelized using a separate thin layer of Python code where all parallel communication is implemented. We provide specific examples on such layers of code, and these examples may act as templates for parallelizing a wide set of serial scientific codes. The use of Python for parallelization is motivated by the fact that the language is well suited for reusing existing serial codes programmed in other languages. The extreme flexibility of Python with regard to handling functions makes it very easy to wrap up decomposed computational tasks of a serial scientific application as Python functions. Many parallelization-specific components can be implemented as generic Python functions, which may take as input those functions that perform concrete computational tasks. The overall programming effort needed by this parallelization approach is rather limited, and the resulting parallel Python scripts have a compact and clean structure. The usefulness of the parallelization approach is exemplified by three different classes of applications in natural and social sciences.},

If the size distribution of the connecting elements is wide (e.g., log-normal–like rather than Gaussian type) the result for the absorption coefficient differs enormously from the conventional Kubo prediction of linear response theory. We use a generalized variable range hopping scheme for the analysis. In particular, we apply this approach to obtain practical approximations for the conductance of mesoscopic rings.

We show that in contrast to the behavior in electronic systems, the transition exists for arbitrarily large disorder, albeit with an exponentially small critical frequency. The structure of the modes reflects a divergent percolation length that arises from the disorder in the springs without being explicitly present in the de?nition of our model. We calculate the speed-of-sound of the delocalized modes (phonons) and corroborate it with numerics.

	abstract = {Hopping motion is considered in a linear chain containing an arbitrary density of particles that are not allowed to hop to occupied sites. The general case of two inequivalent lattice sites A and B is treated. Transition-rate equations are solved by Monte Carlo simulation and, where possible, by analytic techniques. Only for the case of equivalent sites do the results here agree with those recently obtained by Huber from nonlinear differential equations for site occupancy which neglect certain correlations. The conductivity is mean-field-like for equivalent sites, but shows sizeable departure for inequivalent sites, having an activation energy increased over the mean-field value. Here "mean-field" behavior is one where the only effect of forbidden hops to occupied sites is to reduce effective transition rates by a factor 1-n, where n is the average occupation number of the site to which a jump occurs. The velocity correlation function is shown to consist of a δ-function part which reproduces the mean-field conductivity and a function β(t) which is negative for times t{\textgreater}0. This is qualitatively quite different from the picture given by Huber's equations. Motion of a single distinguishable particle shows an anomalous x2∝t1/2 dependence of the mean square displacement upon time t, but the displacement X of all the particles does obey a diffusion relation X2∝t. This difference is explained in terms of the number of particles which have to be pushed aside in order for a particle to move a distance x, and in terms of the ensuing density fluctuation. Differences between time dependences and attempt fequencies as measured by bulk conductivity and microscopic probes such as {NMR} are noted and discussed in light of data on the one-dimensional superionic conductor β eucryptite ({LiAlSiO4).} Reinterpretation of {NMR} relaxation data on some of the organic charge-transfer salts is also suggested.},

Here we present results of a direct numerical study of the conjecture for the Anderson model. They were obtained by calculating the Landauer-Büttiker conductance {gL} for a sample connected to perfect leads and the distribution of level curvatures for the same sample in an isolated ring geometry, when the ring is pierced by an Aharonov-Bohm flux. In the diffusive regime (L≫:le) the average conductance {〈gL〉} is proportional to the mean absolute curvature 〈{\textbar}c{\textbar}〉, {〈gL〉=π〈{\textbar}c{\textbar}〉/Δ}, provided the system size L is large enough, so that the contact resistance can be neglected. le is the elastic mean free path, and Δ is the mean level spacing. When approaching the ballistic regime, the limitation of the conductance due to the contact resistance becomes essential and expresses itself in a deviation from the above proportionality. However, in both regimes and for all system sizes the same proportionality is recovered when the contact resistance is subtracted from the inverse conductance, showing that the curvatures measure the conductance in the bulk. In the localized regime, the mean logarithm of the absolute curvature and the mean logarithm of the Landauer-Büttiker conductance are proportional.},

	abstract = {We study clustering and percolation phenomena for a model of statistically inhomogeneous two-phase random media, including functionally graded materials. This model consists of inhomogeneous fully penetrable (Poisson distributed) disks and can be constructed for any specified variation of volume fraction. We quantify the transition zone in the model, defined by the frontier of the cluster of disks which are connected to the disk-covered portion of the model, by defining the coastline function and correlation functions for the coastline. We find that the behavior of these functions becomes largely independent of the specific choice of grade in volume fraction as the separation of length scales becomes large. We also show that the correlation function behaves in a manner similar to that of fractal Brownian motion. Finally, we study fractal characteristics of the frontier itself and compare to similar properties for two-dimensional percolation on a lattice. In particular, we show that the average location of the frontier appears to be related to the percolation threshold for homogeneous fully penetrable disks. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

Samples consisting of two compartments, a reservoir of {H2O} gel attached to a percolation model object, which was initially filled with {D2O}, were examined with nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy for rendering proton spin density maps. The propagating proton/deuteron interdiffusion profiles were recorded and evaluated with respect to anomalous diffusion parameters. The deviation of the concentration profiles from those expected for unobstructed diffusion directly reflects the anomaly of the propagator for diffusion on a percolation cluster. The fractal dimension of the random walk dw evaluated from the diffusion measurements on the one hand and the fractal dimension df deduced from the spin density map of the percolation object on the other permits one to experimentally compare dynamical and static exponents. Approximate calculations of the propagator are given on the basis of the fractional diffusion equation. Furthermore, the ordinary diffusion equation was solved numerically for the corresponding initial and boundary conditions for comparison. The anomalous diffusion constant was evaluated and is compared to the Brownian case. Some ad hoc correction of the propagator is shown to pay tribute to the finiteness of the system. In this way, anomalous solutions of the fractional diffusion equation could experimentally be verified.},

Scaling theories and numerical simulations are important tools to describe diffusion processes (random walks: the ‘ant in the labyrinth’) on percolation systems and fractals. Different types of disordered systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion are presented (the incipient infinite percolation cluster, diffusion-limited aggregation clusters, lattice animals, and random combs), and scaling theories as well as numerical simulations of greater sophistication are described. Also, diffusion in the presence of singular distributions of transition rates is discussed and related to anomalous diffusion on disordered structures.},

We develop a strict approach to these problems. We derive an exact closed set of integral equations, which provide the averages of the Laplacian operator’s resolvent. This enables us to describe the propagation of a signal and random walks on the network. We show that the determining parameter in this problem is the minimum degree qm of vertices in the network and that the high-degree part of the degree distribution is not that essential. The position of the lower edge of the Laplacian spectrum λc appears to be the same as in the regular Bethe lattice with the coordination number qm. Namely, λc{\textgreater}0 if qm{\textgreater}2, and λc=0 if qm≤2. In both of these cases the density of eigenvalues ρ(λ)→0 as λ→λc+0, but the limiting behaviors near λc are very different. In terms of a distance from a starting vertex, the hopping propagator is a steady moving Gaussian, broadening with time. This picture qualitatively coincides with that for a regular Bethe lattice. Our analytical results include the spectral density ρ(λ) near λc and the long-time asymptotics of the autocorrelator and the propagator.},

One method, based on writing the so-called resolvent function as a Taylor series, allows us to group the diagrams into a small number of topological classes, providing a simple way to determine the infrared (small momenta) behaviour of the theory up to third order, which is of interest for the comparison with experiments.

	abstract = {Quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum theory. It is therefore surprising that physicists have been unable to agree on what a quantum state represents. There are at least two opposing schools of thought, each almost as old as quantum theory itself. One is that a pure state is a physical property of system, much like position and momentum in classical mechanics. Another is that even a pure state has only a statistical significance, akin to a probability distribution in statistical mechanics. Here we show that, given only very mild assumptions, the statistical interpretation of the quantum state is inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory. This result holds even in the presence of small amounts of experimental noise, and is therefore amenable to experimental test using present or near-future technology. If the predictions of quantum theory are confirmed, such a test would show that distinct quantum states must correspond to physically distinct states of reality.},

The sampling properties of various estimators of the harmonic mean are derived and compared for observations arising from a lognormal distribution. Previous applications have recommended the use of a moment estimator of the harmonic mean. We document that the moment estimator of the harmonic mean exhibits significant upward bias and large root-mean-square error, particularly for large skews. A maximum likelihood estimator of the harmonic mean is generally preferred because it is nearly unbiased and can provide dramatic reductions in the root-mean-square error, compared with the moment estimator.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to demonstrate, by simple numerical simulations, the main transport properties of disordered electron systems. These systems undergo the metal insulator transition when either Fermi energy crosses the mobility edge or the strength of the disorder increases over critical value. We study how disorder affects the energy spectrum and spatial distribution of electronic eigenstates in the diffusive and insulating regime, as well as in the critical region of the metal-insulator transition. Then, we introduce the transfer matrix and conductance, and we discuss how the quantum character of the electron propagation influences the transport properties of disordered samples. In the weakly disordered systems, the weak localization and anti-localization as well as the universal conductance fluctuation are numerically simulated and discussed. The localization in the one dimensional system is described and interpreted as a purely quantum effect. Statistical properties of the conductance in the critical and localized regimes are demonstrated. Special attention is given to the numerical study of the transport properties of the critical regime and to the numerical verification of the single parameter scaling theory of localization. Numerical data for the critical exponent in the orthogonal models in dimension 2 d , ≤ 5 are compared with theoretical predictions. We argue that the discrepancy between the theory and numerical data is due to the absence of the self-averaging of transmission quantities. This complicates the analytical analysis of the disordered systems. Finally, theoretical methods of description of weakly disordered systems are explained and their possible generalization to the localized regime is discussed. Since we concentrate on the one-electron propagation at zero temperature, no effects of electron-electron interaction and incoherent scattering are discussed in the paper.},

If the one dimensional {RE} is i. i. d., then our approach leads to a complete and constructive classification of possible types of asymptotic behaviour of recurrent random walks. Namely, the {RW} exhibits the (log t)2 asymptotic behaviour if the distribution of the {RE} is not supported by a hyperplane in the space of parameters which shall be explicitly described.

However, where the distribution of nodes is inhomogeneous in some way, this ceases to be the case, with consequences for the distribution of neighborhood sizes within the network, the correlation between the number of neighbors of connected nodes, and the way in which the largest connected component of the network grows as the density of edges is increased.

This classification scheme is useful for regular and random lattices and shows the connection between bond and site percolation models. With the aid of a large computer we have used Monte Carlo techniques to solve many random-lattice percolation models in two and three dimensions. These models illustrate the effects of hard-core interactions between sites, of deterministic and probabilistic bonding parameters, and of changing the functional form of the bonding criterion. The random-lattice solutions are used to examine the critical volume fraction concept and the critical number of bonds per site (Bc) concept. These concepts have been previously proposed as methods of obtaining solutions to percolation problems.

To first order in the electric field, the solution to the steady-state and current equations is shown to be equivalent to the solution of a linear resistance network. The network resistance is evaluated and the result shows that the T dependence of the resistivity is ρ{\textasciitilde}exp({ɛ3kT).} For small K, ɛ3=(e2κ0)({4πnD3)13(1-1.35K13)}, where κ0 is the dielectric constant. At higher K, ɛ3 and ρ attain a minimum near K=0.5. The dependence on {nD} is extracted; the agreement of the latter and of ɛ3 with experiment is satisfactory. The magnitude of ρ is in fair agreement with experiment. The influence of excited donor states on ρ is discussed.},

	doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.53.175},
	abstract = {The authors investigate the asymptotic (low-frequency or long-time) behavior of random one-dimensional systems described by a master equation of the form {CndPndt=Wn},n-1(Pn-1-{Pn)+Wn},n+1(Pn+1-Pn), where either the Cn or the Wn,n+1({=Wn+1},n) are independent positive random variables. This problem can be mapped onto a variety of physical problems, including one-dimensional particle or excitation diffusion with random spatial transfer rates or random trap depths, low-temperature properties of the random one-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet, one-dimensional tight-binding fermion systems with correlated diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, and electrical lines of random conductances or capacitances. Replacing {dPndt} by {d2Pndt2}, the above equations also describe a harmonic chain with random force constants or random masses. Both the random W and the random C problem are shown to reduce to the same mathematical problem, and the authors review the derivation and consequences of its exact asymptotic solution for some general classes of probability densities. In particular, they are able to determine the exact ω--{\textgreater}0 asymptotic behavior of the single-site Green function, and thus the low-energy density of states and (for diffusion-type problems) the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation function. For diffusion-type problems, the investigators further introduce a scaling hypothesis (based on the assumption of the existence of a single characteristic length) for the time dependence of the excitation amplitude at sites other than the initially excited site. This allows the calculation of the low-frequency diffusion constant, and with the help of the Einstein relation, the low-frequency conductivity. The authors apply their results to several physical systems and, in particular, are able to account quantitatively for the complex low-frequency conductivity of the one-dimensional superionic conductor hollandite. The results may also be relevant to quasi-one-dimensional electronic systems for times (or frequencies) such that diffusion is restricted to a single dimension. The expansion of an earlier scaling approach gives additional insight into the physical meaning of the asymptotic solutions. The researchers further discuss effective-medium-type approximations, which, apart from a numerical prefactor, lead to the correct asymptotic dependences. Comparison is made with the results of alternative approaches to this type of problem, specifically with those of the continuous time random walk. The authors exhibit the remarkable satisfaction of the hyperscaling relations for the specific heat and correlation function critical exponents for the random Heisenberg ferromagnet, even though the exponents themselves are not universal. Finally, aspects of the problem which remain unsolved, or which are only partly resolved, are discussed. These include the derivation of asymptotic expansions beyond the leading term, the derivation of rigorous asymptotic expressions for the conductivity, the calculation of fluctuations in the site occupancy probabilities for the diffusion problem, and the treatment of the random one-dimensional antiferromagnet and random one-dimensional xy model. The investigators close with a short description of an application of this work to electronic conduction in highly anisotropic materials.},

Readers are expected to be able to handle some fundamental mathematical procedures, such as integration and differentiation of single variable functions, probability and statistics. Computer programming experience in Fortran is also useful. While percolation is treated as a fundamentally physical concept, its relevance to various natural and living systems is addressed. Much of the book deals with systems lying close to the critical point phase transition point, where the subject is at its most interesting and sensitive.

A possible exception is the case of transverse measurements on thin amorphous films.

A percolation model for hopping conduction is set up using Miller and Abrahams' impedance representation of the problem. Approximate solutions for the model yield expressions for dc hopping conductivity. It is found that the density of states functions effects the temperature dependence of the conductivity. When the density of states is constant within a certain region around the Fermi level Mott's T−14 law is obtained. For a density appropriate for impurity conduction at small compensations an activated conductivity is obtained. When the density of states increases as the nth power of the distance from the Fermi energy the logarithm of the resistivity is a linear function of Tsu−(n+1)/(n+4).

Some comparison of the theory with experiments on impurity conduction and on amorphous semiconductors is made.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the transient photocurrent I(t) in an increasing number of inorganic and organic amorphous materials display anomalous transport properties. The long tail of I(t) indicates a dispersion of carrier transit times. However, the shape invariance of I(t) to electric field and sample thickness (designated as universality for the classes of materials here considered) is incompatible with traditional concepts of statistical spreading, i.e., a Gaussian carrier packet. We have developed a stochastic transport model for I(t) which describes the dynamics of a carrier packet executing a time-dependent random walk in the presence of a field-dependent spatial bias and an absorbing barrier at the sample surface. The time dependence of the random walk is governed by hopping time distribution Ψ(t). A packet, generated with a Ψ(t) characteristic of hopping in a disordered system [e.g., Ψ(t)∼t-(1+α), 0{\textless}α{\textless}1], is shown to propagate with a number of anomalous non-Gaussian properties. The calculated I(t) associated with this packet not only obeys the property of universality but can account quantitatively for a large variety of experiments. The new method of data analysis advanced by the theory allows one to directly extract the transit time even for a featureless current trace. In particular, we shall analyze both an inorganic (a-{As2Se3)} and an organic (trinitrofluorenone-polyvinylcarbazole) system. Our function Ψ(t) is related to a first-principles calculation. It is to be emphasized that these Ψ(t)'s characterize a realization of a non-Markoffian transport process. Moreover, the theory shows the limitations of the concept of a mobility in this dispersive type of transport.},

A model that satisfactorily describes the hopping rates in the system and avoids the explicit calculation of electron–phonon coupling constants was then proposed and verified. Our results indicate that, in addition to electronic density of states, the phonon density of states and the spatial overlap of the wave functions are the quantities necessary to properly describe carrier hopping in disordered conjugated polymers.},

	abstract = {We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices where the matrix elements depend exponentially on the distance between uniformly and randomly distributed points. This model arises naturally in various physical contexts, such as the diffusion of particles, slow relaxations in glasses, and scalar phonon localization. Using a combination of a renormalization group procedure and a direct moment calculation, we find the eigenvalue distribution density (i.e., the spectrum), for low densities, and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, for arbitrary dimension. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of the results.},

	abstract = {In recent years the phenomenon of anomalous diffusion has attracted more and more attention. One of the main impulses was initiated by de Gennes' idea of the “ant in the labyrinth”. Several authors presented asymptotic probability density functions for the location of a random walker on a fractal object. As this density function and the time dependence of its second moment are now well established, a modified diffusion equation providing the correct result is formulated. The parameters of this fractional partial differential equation are uniquely determined by the fractal Hausdorff dimension of the underlying object and the anomalous diffusion exponent. The presented equation reduces exactly to the ordinary isotropic diffusion equation by appropriate choice of the parameters. A closed form solution is given in terms of Fox's H-function. In the asymptotic case a “halved” diffusion equation can be established. Furthermore, the differences to equations considered previously are discussed.},

For such networks the analysis of the Schrödinger operator reduces to the study of small matrices. We analyse various classes of such networks qualitatively and solve explicitly a representative model in each class. We find two scenarios that are the analogs of the integer and classical Hall effects. In particular, the adiabatic transport at zero temperature for noninteracting Fermions, is an integer in one scenario and a real (i.e., non-integer) number, in the other. We also discuss an interpretation of the results in terms of the scattering data. This leads to Landauer type formulas for adiabatic transport.},

A question arises whether such a transition happens in higher dimensions. Numerically D can be evaluated using a resistor network calculation, or optionally it can be deduced from the spectral properties of the system. Contrary to a recent expectation that is based on a renormalization-group analysis, we deduce that D is finite, suggest an “effective-range-hopping” procedure to evaluate it, and contrast the results with the linear estimate. The same approach is useful in the analysis of networks that are described by quasi-one-dimensional sparse banded matrices.},
