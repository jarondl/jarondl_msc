        <h2>Diffusion and localization in sparse networks</h2>
        <p>
            We consider d-dimensional networks, with dynamics described
            by a rate equation
            \[ \frac{dp_n}{dt} \ \  = \ \ \sum_m w_{nm} p_m \\
               -w_{nn} \ \  =\ \  \gamma_n \ \ \equiv \ \ \sum_{m\neq n} w_{mn} \]
            Specifically, in what we call the 
            <em>random site hopping model</em>, the sites are 
            randomly distributed in space, and the rates depend on
            the distance between sites:
            \[ w_{nm} \ \ =\ \ w_0 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\left|r_n-r_m\right|}{\xi} - \varepsilon_{nm}\right)\]
            Where \(\xi\) is a global parameter defining the sparsity of the system,
            and \(\varepsilon\) is a random parameter defined per bond.

        some sites are better connected to others.</figcaption>

        <h3>Determining the diffusion coefficient \(D\)</h3>
        <p> The long term behavior of the system is characterized by
        a diffusion coefficient \(D\). It is defined by the long term spreading:
        \[ S(t)\quad = \quad \left\langle r^2(t)\right\rangle \quad \sim \quad D t\]
        And it is also related to the long time survival probability:
        \[ \mathcal{P}(t)\quad \sim \quad \frac{1}{(Dt)^{1/2}} \]
        And to the low eigenvalue distribution (by Laplace transform):
        \[ \mathcal{N}(\lambda) \quad \sim \quad \left[ \frac{\lambda}{D}\right]^{d/2} \]

        <h3>Effective range hopping</h3>
        <p>
            For a dense system, (large \(\xi\) compared to typical site distance),
            the diffusion coefficient can be estimated by a linear equation (linear in the rates):
            \[ D = \frac{1}{2d}\sum_r w(r) r^2 \]
            For a sparse system, we can estimate the coefficient by the known VRH procedure.
            We present the ERH procedure, which has a smooth cross-over between those two
            regimes. For our random hopping models it gives:
            \[ D_{\textrm{ERH}} \quad =\quad \textrm{EXP}_{d+2}\left(\frac{1}{s_c}\right) \mbox{e}^{-1/s_c} D_{linear} \\
            s_c\quad=\quad \left(\frac{d}{\Omega_c} n_c\right)^{-1/d}\frac{\xi}{r_0} \\
            \textrm{EXP}_{l}(x) \quad = \quad \sum_{k=0}^l \frac{1}{k!}x^k\]
