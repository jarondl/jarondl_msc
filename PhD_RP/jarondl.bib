These fractional equations are derived asymptotically from basic random walk models, and from a generalised master equation. Several physical consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some special cases exact solutions are calculated. This report demonstrates that fractional equations have come of age as a complementary tool in the description of anomalous transport processes.},

The {“Ariadne's} clew” we follow is understanding of the general statistical mechanisms which may generate “anomalous” (non-Brownian) diffusion laws; this allows us to develop simple arguments to obtain a qualitative (but often quite accurate) picture of most situations. Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed.},

can give rise to a poor estimate of the linear response function. The 
first concerns the accessibility of the generalized 
fluctuation-dissipation relation due to the finite number of actual 
perturbations imposed to the control parameter. The second concerns the 
propagation of the error made at the initial sampling of the external 
perturbation of the system. This can be highly enhanced by introducing 
an estimator which corrects the error of the initial sampled condition. 
When these two effects are taken into account in the data analysis, the 
generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation is verified experimentally.},

We also show that if percolation occurs, then there is exactly one infinite cluster. Another percolation model is obtained by putting balls of radius zero around each point of X and let the radii grow linearly in time until they hit another ball. We show that this model exists and that there is no percolation in the limiting configuration.

Systems where a network and interacting agents on it influence each other are also discussed. A wide range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation, phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks are mentioned.

	abstract = {In mammals, mitochondria and mitochondrial {DNA} {(mtDNA)} are transmitted through the female germ line. Mature oocytes contain at least 100,000 copies of {mtDNA}, organized at 1–2 copies per organelle. Despite the high genome copy number, {mtDNA} sequence variants are observed to segregate rapidly between generations, and this has led to the concept of a developmental bottleneck for the transmission of {mtDNA.} Ultrastructural investigations of primordial germ cells show that they contain approximately 10 mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial biogenesis is arrested during early embryogenesis, and that the mitochondria contributing to the germ cell precursors are simply apportioned from those present in the zygote. Thus, as few as 0.01\% of the mitochondria in the oocyte actually contribute to the offspring of the next generation. Mitochondrial replication restarts in the migrating primordial germ cells, and mitochondrial numbers steadily increase to a few thousand in primordial oocytes. Genetic evidence from both heteroplasmic mice and human pedigrees suggests that segregation of {mtDNA} sequence variants is largely a stochastic process that occurs during the mitotic divisions of the germ cell precursors. This process is essentially complete by the time the primary oocyte population is differentiated in fetal life. Analysis of the distribution of pathogenic {mtDNA} mutations in the offspring of carrier mothers shows that risk of inheriting a pathogenic mutation increases with the proportion in the mother, but there is no bias toward transmitting more or less of the mutant {mtDNAs.} This implies that there is no strong selection against oocytes carrying pathogenic mutations and that atresia is not a filter for oocyte quality based on oxidative phosphorylation capacity. The large number of mitochondria and {mtDNAs} present in the oocyte may simply represent a genetic mechanism to ensure their distribution to the gametes and somatic cells of the next generation. If true, {mtDNA} copy number, and by inference mitochondrial number, may be the most important determinant of oocyte quality, not because of the effects on oocyte metabolism, but because too few would result in a maldistribution in the early embryo. © 2007, Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Unlike wired networks, wireless networks do not come with links. Rather, links have to be fashioned out of the ether by nodes choosing neighbors to connect to. Moreover the location of the nodes may be {random.The} question that we resolve is: How many neighbors should each node be connected to in order that the overall network is connected in a multi-hop fashion? We show that in a network with n randomly placed nodes, each node should be connected to Θ(log n) nearest neighbors. If each node is connected to less than 0.074 log n nearest neighbors then the network is asymptotically disconnected with probability one as n increases, while if each node is connected to more than 5.1774 log n nearest neighbors then the network is asymptotically connected with probability approaching one as n increases. It appears that the critical constant may be close to one, but that remains an open {problem.These} results should be contrasted with some works in the 1970s and 1980s which suggested that the "magic number" of nearest neighbors should be six or eight.},

	abstract = {Carrier hopping in disordered semiconducting polymers: How accurate is the Miller-Abrahams model? Nenad Vukmirovi´ and Lin-Wang Wang c Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, {CA} 94720, {USA.} We performed direct calculations of carrier hopping rates in strongly disordered conjugated poly- mers based on the atomic structure of the system, the corresponding electronic states and their coupling to all phonon modes. We found that the dependence of hopping rates on distance and the dependence of the mobility on temperature are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than the ones stemming from the simple Miller-Abrahams model, regardless of the choice of the parameters in the model. A model that satisfactorily describes the hopping rates in the system and avoids the explicit calcu- lation of electron-phonon coupling constants was then proposed and veriﬁed. Our results indicate that, in addition to electronic density of states, the phonon density of states and the spatial overlap of the wavefunctions are the quantities necessary to properly describe carrier hopping in disordered conjugated polymers. The carrier mobility of conjugated polymer materials is the most important physical property 1–6 for their applica- tion in organic electronic devices. Realistic polymer ma- terials contain both crystalline (ordered) and amorphous (disordered) regions. 7 Charge carrier transport is often limited by the presence of amorphous regions. In these regions the electronic states are localized due to presence of disorder and carrier transport takes place by phonon- assisted carrier hopping 8 between localized states. Such transport is traditionally modeled by assuming a certain density of electronic states in energy and space and a cer- tain form of hopping probabilities between them. 6,9–12 Dif- ferent models are distinguished by the electronic density of states {(DOS)} assumed in the model, which is usually the tail of the Gaussian 9,10,12 or the exponential 11 dis- tribution. The transition rates are typically assumed to decay exponentially with the distance between localized states, 9–12 in the Miller-Abrahams {(MA)} form. 13 Free pa- rameters that appear in the models are ﬁtted to the ex- perimental mobility measurements. From the applications of such models, it is widely un- derstood that the mobility of the material strongly de- pends on the electronic {DOS} which is therefore believed to be the most important material property when charge transport is concerned. 14 On the other hand, much less ef- fort has been put into understanding how diﬀerent forms of the transition rates aﬀect the transport and in partic- ular whether the {MA} expression is suitable at all. To address these questions, in this letter we perform direct ab-initio calculations of the transition rates between elec- tronic states starting from atomic structure of the system, followed by explicit calculation of electronic state wave- functions and their coupling to phonons. We ﬁnd strong deviations of the transition rate dependence on distance from the {MA} form and analyze the consequences of this on electronic transport. Electronic structure calculations were performed using the plane wave pseudopotential approach and the charge patching method for organic systems introduced in Ref. 15 which gives the accuracy similar to the density functional theory in local density approximation, but with a much smaller computational cost.

In particular, as P(k)∼k-γ, ρ(λ)∼{\textbar}λ{\textbar}1-2γ. We propose a simple approximation, which enables us to calculate spectra of various graphs analytically.

We study the case of ‘‘dynamic’’ disorder whereby the random environment is renewed at each successive jump of the hopping particle, and also the case of ‘‘static’’ disorder with frozen randomly distributed barriers. The transition characteristics are governed by Boltzmann statistics. We employ standard Monte Carlo techniques to monitor properties such as the mean-square displacement. The trends of the motion are shown to include local trapping at early times, allowing for the search of a crossover time to the conventional diffusive regime, {〈R2〉∼t}, as a function of temperature. We find that the crossover time versus temperature dependence is of the Arrhenius type determined by an effective activation energy barrier for percolation in the case of static disorder. For a uniform distribution of the barriers, this activation barrier is shown to coincide with the threshold concentration for bond percolation, as simple arguments suggest. We also demonstrate that an increase in the degree of dynamic disorder leads to an increase in the particle mobility. Some relationships of the present model to several experimental systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show how existing scientific software can be parallelized using a separate thin layer of Python code where all parallel communication is implemented. We provide specific examples on such layers of code, and these examples may act as templates for parallelizing a wide set of serial scientific codes. The use of Python for parallelization is motivated by the fact that the language is well suited for reusing existing serial codes programmed in other languages. The extreme flexibility of Python with regard to handling functions makes it very easy to wrap up decomposed computational tasks of a serial scientific application as Python functions. Many parallelization-specific components can be implemented as generic Python functions, which may take as input those functions that perform concrete computational tasks. The overall programming effort needed by this parallelization approach is rather limited, and the resulting parallel Python scripts have a compact and clean structure. The usefulness of the parallelization approach is exemplified by three different classes of applications in natural and social sciences.},

We quantify the transition zone in the model, defined by the frontier of the cluster of disks which are connected to the disk-covered portion of the model, by defining the coastline function and correlation functions for the coastline. We find that the behavior of these functions becomes largely independent of the specific choice of grade in volume fraction as the separation of length scales becomes large. We also show that the correlation function behaves in a manner similar to that of fractal Brownian motion. Finally, we study fractal characteristics of the frontier itself and compare to similar properties for two-dimensional percolation on a lattice. In particular, we show that the average location of the frontier appears to be related to the percolation threshold for homogeneous fully penetrable disks. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

Samples consisting of two compartments, a reservoir of {H2O} gel attached to a percolation model object, which was initially filled with {D2O}, were examined with nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy for rendering proton spin density maps. The propagating proton/deuteron interdiffusion profiles were recorded and evaluated with respect to anomalous diffusion parameters. The deviation of the concentration profiles from those expected for unobstructed diffusion directly reflects the anomaly of the propagator for diffusion on a percolation cluster. The fractal dimension of the random walk dw evaluated from the diffusion measurements on the one hand and the fractal dimension df deduced from the spin density map of the percolation object on the other permits one to experimentally compare dynamical and static exponents. Approximate calculations of the propagator are given on the basis of the fractional diffusion equation. Furthermore, the ordinary diffusion equation was solved numerically for the corresponding initial and boundary conditions for comparison. The anomalous diffusion constant was evaluated and is compared to the Brownian case. Some ad hoc correction of the propagator is shown to pay tribute to the finiteness of the system. In this way, anomalous solutions of the fractional diffusion equation could experimentally be verified.},

We develop a strict approach to these problems. We derive an exact closed set of integral equations, which provide the averages of the Laplacian operator’s resolvent. This enables us to describe the propagation of a signal and random walks on the network. We show that the determining parameter in this problem is the minimum degree qm of vertices in the network and that the high-degree part of the degree distribution is not that essential. The position of the lower edge of the Laplacian spectrum λc appears to be the same as in the regular Bethe lattice with the coordination number qm. Namely, λc{\textgreater}0 if qm{\textgreater}2, and λc=0 if qm≤2. In both of these cases the density of eigenvalues ρ(λ)→0 as λ→λc+0, but the limiting behaviors near λc are very different. In terms of a distance from a starting vertex, the hopping propagator is a steady moving Gaussian, broadening with time. This picture qualitatively coincides with that for a regular Bethe lattice. Our analytical results include the spectral density ρ(λ) near λc and the long-time asymptotics of the autocorrelator and the propagator.},

	abstract = {We suggest a method for embedding scale-free networks, with degree distribution P(k)∼k-λ, in regular Euclidean lattices accounting for geographical properties. The embedding is driven by a natural constraint of minimization of the total length of the links in the system. We find that all networks with λ{\textgreater}2 can be successfully embedded up to a {(Euclidean)} distance ξ which can be made as large as desired upon the changing of an external parameter. Clusters of successive chemical shells are found to be compact (the fractal dimension is df=d), while the dimension of the shortest path between any two sites is smaller than 1: dmin=(λ-2)/(λ-1-1/d), contrary to all other known examples of fractals and disordered lattices.},

	abstract = {Quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum theory. It is therefore surprising that physicists have been unable to agree on what a quantum state represents. There are at least two opposing schools of thought, each almost as old as quantum theory itself. One is that a pure state is a physical property of system, much like position and momentum in classical mechanics. Another is that even a pure state has only a statistical significance, akin to a probability distribution in statistical mechanics. Here we show that, given only very mild assumptions, the statistical interpretation of the quantum state is inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory. This result holds even in the presence of small amounts of experimental noise, and is therefore amenable to experimental test using present or near-future technology. If the predictions of quantum theory are confirmed, such a test would show that distinct quantum states must correspond to physically distinct states of reality.},

The sampling properties of various estimators of the harmonic mean are derived and compared for observations arising from a lognormal distribution. Previous applications have recommended the use of a moment estimator of the harmonic mean. We document that the moment estimator of the harmonic mean exhibits significant upward bias and large root-mean-square error, particularly for large skews. A maximum likelihood estimator of the harmonic mean is generally preferred because it is nearly unbiased and can provide dramatic reductions in the root-mean-square error, compared with the moment estimator. In addition, a maximum likelihood estimator of the generalized mean (or p-norm) of a lognormal distribution is introduced.},

If the size-distribution of the connecting elements is wide (e.g. log-normal-like rather than Gaussian-like) the result for the absorption coefficient differs enormously from the conventional Kubo prediction of linear response theory.

This classification scheme is useful for regular and random lattices and shows the connection between bond and site percolation models. With the aid of a large computer we have used Monte Carlo techniques to solve many random-lattice percolation models in two and three dimensions. These models illustrate the effects of hard-core interactions between sites, of deterministic and probabilistic bonding parameters, and of changing the functional form of the bonding criterion. The random-lattice solutions are used to examine the critical volume fraction concept and the critical number of bonds per site {(Bc)} concept. These concepts have been previously proposed as methods of obtaining solutions to percolation problems.

	title = {Excitation dynamics in random one-dimensional systems},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981RvMP...53..175A},
	doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.53.175},
	abstract = {The authors investigate the asymptotic (low-frequency or long-time) behavior of random one-dimensional systems described by a master equation of the form {CndPndt=Wn},n-{1(Pn-1-Pn)+Wn}{,n+1(Pn+1-Pn)}, where either the Cn or the {Wn,n+1(=Wn+1},n) are independent positive random variables. This problem can be mapped onto a variety of physical problems, including one-dimensional particle or excitation diffusion with random spatial transfer rates or random trap depths, low-temperature properties of the random one-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet, one-dimensional tight-binding fermion systems with correlated diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, and electrical lines of random conductances or capacitances. Replacing {dPndt} by {d2Pndt2}, the above equations also describe a harmonic chain with random force constants or random masses. Both the random W and the random C problem are shown to reduce to the same mathematical problem, and the authors review the derivation and consequences of its exact asymptotic solution for some general classes of probability densities. In particular, they are able to determine the exact ω--{\textgreater}0 asymptotic behavior of the single-site Green function, and thus the low-energy density of states and (for diffusion-type problems) the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation function. For diffusion-type problems, the investigators further introduce a scaling hypothesis (based on the assumption of the existence of a single characteristic length) for the time dependence of the excitation amplitude at sites other than the initially excited site. This allows the calculation of the low-frequency diffusion constant, and with the help of the Einstein relation, the low-frequency conductivity. The authors apply their results to several physical systems and, in particular, are able to account quantitatively for the complex low-frequency conductivity of the one-dimensional superionic conductor hollandite. The results may also be relevant to quasi-one-dimensional electronic systems for times (or frequencies) such that diffusion is restricted to a single dimension. The expansion of an earlier scaling approach gives additional insight into the physical meaning of the asymptotic solutions. The researchers further discuss effective-medium-type approximations, which, apart from a numerical prefactor, lead to the correct asymptotic dependences. Comparison is made with the results of alternative approaches to this type of problem, specifically with those of the continuous time random walk. The authors exhibit the remarkable satisfaction of the hyperscaling relations for the specific heat and correlation function critical exponents for the random Heisenberg ferromagnet, even though the exponents themselves are not universal. Finally, aspects of the problem which remain unsolved, or which are only partly resolved, are discussed. These include the derivation of asymptotic expansions beyond the leading term, the derivation of rigorous asymptotic expressions for the conductivity, the calculation of fluctuations in the site occupancy probabilities for the diffusion problem, and the treatment of the random one-dimensional antiferromagnet and random one-dimensional xy model. The investigators close with a short description of an application of this work to electronic conduction in highly anisotropic materials.},

A possible exception is the case of transverse measurements on thin amorphous films.

A percolation model for hopping conduction is set up using Miller and Abrahams' impedance representation of the problem. Approximate solutions for the model yield expressions for dc hopping conductivity. It is found that the density of states functions effects the temperature dependence of the conductivity. When the density of states is constant within a certain region around the Fermi level Mott's T−14 law is obtained. For a density appropriate for impurity conduction at small compensations an activated conductivity is obtained. When the density of states increases as the nth power of the distance from the Fermi energy the logarithm of the resistivity is a linear function of Tsu−(n+1)/(n+4).

Some comparison of the theory with experiments on impurity conduction and on amorphous semiconductors is made.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the transient photocurrent I(t) in an increasing number of inorganic and organic amorphous materials display anomalous transport properties. The long tail of I(t) indicates a dispersion of carrier transit times. However, the shape invariance of I(t) to electric field and sample thickness (designated as universality for the classes of materials here considered) is incompatible with traditional concepts of statistical spreading, i.e., a Gaussian carrier packet. We have developed a stochastic transport model for I(t) which describes the dynamics of a carrier packet executing a time-dependent random walk in the presence of a field-dependent spatial bias and an absorbing barrier at the sample surface. The time dependence of the random walk is governed by hopping time distribution Ψ(t). A packet, generated with a Ψ(t) characteristic of hopping in a disordered system [e.g., Ψ(t)∼t-(1+α), 0{\textless}α{\textless}1], is shown to propagate with a number of anomalous non-Gaussian properties. The calculated I(t) associated with this packet not only obeys the property of universality but can account quantitatively for a large variety of experiments. The new method of data analysis advanced by the theory allows one to directly extract the transit time even for a featureless current trace. In particular, we shall analyze both an inorganic (a-{As2Se3)} and an organic (trinitrofluorenone-polyvinylcarbazole) system. Our function Ψ(t) is related to a first-principles calculation. It is to be emphasized that these Ψ(t)'s characterize a realization of a non-Markoffian transport process. Moreover, the theory shows the limitations of the concept of a mobility in this dispersive type of transport.},

	abstract = {Sinai's walk is a recurrent one-dimensional nearest-neighbor random walk in random environment. It is known for a phenomenon of strong localization, namely, the walk spends almost all time at or near the bottom of deep valleys of the potential. Our main result shows a weakness of this localization phenomenon: with probability one, the zones where the walk stays for the most time can be far away from the sites where the walk spends the most time. In particular, this gives a negative answer to a problem of Erd{\textbackslash}H{o}s and R{\textbackslash}'{e}v{\textbackslash}'{e}sz {[Mathematical} Structures--Computational Mathematics--Mathematical Modelling 2 (1984) 152--157], originally formulated for the usual homogeneous random walk.},

Several authors presented asymptotic probability density functions for the location of a random walker on a fractal object. As this density function and the time dependence of its second moment are now well established, a modified diffusion equation providing the correct result is formulated. The parameters of this fractional partial differential equation are uniquely determined by the fractal Hausdorff dimension of the underlying object and the anomalous diffusion exponent. The presented equation reduces exactly to the ordinary isotropic diffusion equation by appropriate choice of the parameters. A closed form solution is given in terms of Fox's H-function. In the asymptotic case a “halved” diffusion equation can be established. Furthermore, the differences to equations considered previously are discussed.},

Due to the "sparsity" of the perturbation matrix, a resistor network picture of transitions between energy levels is essential. The Kubo formula is modified, replacing the "algebraic" average over the squared matrix elements by a "resistor network" average. Consequently the response becomes semi-linear rather than linear. Some novel results have been obtained in the context of two prototype problems: the heating rate of particles in Billiards with vibrating walls; and the Ohmic Joule conductance of mesoscopic rings driven by electromotive force. Respectively, the obtained results are contrasted with the {"Wall} formula" and the {"Drude} formula".},

For such networks the analysis of the Schrödinger operator reduces to the study of small matrices. We analyse various classes of such networks qualitatively and solve explicitly a representative model in each class. We find two scenarios that are the analogs of the integer and classical Hall effects. In particular, the adiabatic transport at zero temperature for noninteracting Fermions, is an integer in one scenario and a real (i.e., non-integer) number, in the other. We also discuss an interpretation of the results in terms of the scattering data. This leads to Landauer type formulas for adiabatic transport.},

	abstract = {We consider a noninteracting disordered system designed to model particle diffusion, relaxation in glasses, and impurity bands of semiconductors. Disorder originates in the random spatial distribution of sites. We find strong numerical evidence that this model displays the same universal behavior as the standard Anderson model. We use finite-size scaling to find the localization length as a function of energy and density, including localized states away from the delocalization transition. Results at many energies all fit onto the same universal scaling curve.},
