  title = {Excitation dynamics in random one-dimensional systems},
  journal = {Reviews of Modern Physics},

  volume = {53},
  pages = {175--198},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {The authors investigate the asymptotic (low-frequency or long-time)
	behavior of random one-dimensional systems described by a master
	equation of the form {CndPndt=Wn},n-{1(Pn-1-Pn)+Wn}{,n+1(Pn+1-Pn)},
	where either the Cn or the {Wn,n+1(=Wn+1},n) are independent positive
	random variables. This problem can be mapped onto a variety of physical
	problems, including one-dimensional particle or excitation diffusion
	with random spatial transfer rates or random trap depths, low-temperature
	properties of the random one-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet,
	one-dimensional tight-binding fermion systems with correlated diagonal
	and off-diagonal disorder, and electrical lines of random conductances
	or capacitances. Replacing {dPndt} by {d2Pndt2}, the above equations
	also describe a harmonic chain with random force constants or random
	masses. Both the random W and the random C problem are shown to reduce
	to the same mathematical problem, and the authors review the derivation
	and consequences of its exact asymptotic solution for some general
	classes of probability densities. In particular, they are able to
	determine the exact ω--{\textgreater}0 asymptotic behavior of the
	single-site Green function, and thus the low-energy density of states
	and (for diffusion-type problems) the long-time behavior of the autocorrelation
	function. For diffusion-type problems, the investigators further
	introduce a scaling hypothesis (based on the assumption of the existence
	of a single characteristic length) for the time dependence of the
	excitation amplitude at sites other than the initially excited site.
	This allows the calculation of the low-frequency diffusion constant,
	and with the help of the Einstein relation, the low-frequency conductivity.
	The authors apply their results to several physical systems and,
	in particular, are able to account quantitatively for the complex
	low-frequency conductivity of the one-dimensional superionic conductor
	hollandite. The results may also be relevant to quasi-one-dimensional
	electronic systems for times (or frequencies) such that diffusion
	is restricted to a single dimension. The expansion of an earlier
	scaling approach gives additional insight into the physical meaning
	of the asymptotic solutions. The researchers further discuss effective-medium-type
	approximations, which, apart from a numerical prefactor, lead to
	the correct asymptotic dependences. Comparison is made with the results
	of alternative approaches to this type of problem, specifically with
	those of the continuous time random walk. The authors exhibit the
	remarkable satisfaction of the hyperscaling relations for the specific
	heat and correlation function critical exponents for the random Heisenberg
	ferromagnet, even though the exponents themselves are not universal.
	Finally, aspects of the problem which remain unsolved, or which are
	only partly resolved, are discussed. These include the derivation
	of asymptotic expansions beyond the leading term, the derivation
	of rigorous asymptotic expressions for the conductivity, the calculation
	of fluctuations in the site occupancy probabilities for the diffusion
	problem, and the treatment of the random one-dimensional antiferromagnet
	and random one-dimensional xy model. The investigators close with
	a short description of an application of this work to electronic
	conduction in highly anisotropic materials.},

	We find that the decay of an excited state to a locally stable state
	is far from being exponential in time and does not have a characteristic
	time scale. Working in a mean-field approximation, we write rate
	equations for the average occupation numbers ⟨ni⟩ and describe the

	the case of ‘‘static’’ disorder with frozen randomly distributed
	barriers. The transition characteristics are governed by Boltzmann
	statistics. We employ standard Monte Carlo techniques to monitor

	crossover time versus temperature dependence is of the Arrhenius
	type determined by an effective activation energy barrier for percolation
	in the case of static disorder. For a uniform distribution of the
	barriers, this activation barrier is shown to coincide with the threshold

	conductivity in a random resistor network allows for elucidating
	possible sources of anomalous diffusion in random potential models.
	We show that subdiffusion is only possible either if the mean Boltzmann

	superdiffusion is impossible in our system under any condition. We

	Due to the "sparsity" of the perturbation matrix, a resistor network
	picture of transitions between energy levels is essential. The Kubo
	formula is modified, replacing the "algebraic" average over the squared
	matrix elements by a "resistor network" average. Consequently the
	response becomes semi-linear rather than linear. Some novel results
	have been obtained in the context of two prototype problems: the
	heating rate of particles in Billiards with vibrating walls; and
	the Ohmic Joule conductance of mesoscopic rings driven by electromotive
	force. Respectively, the obtained results are contrasted with the

	exactly to the ordinary isotropic diffusion equation by appropriate
	choice of the parameters. A closed form solution is given in terms
	of Fox's H-function. In the asymptotic case a “halved” diffusion
	equation can be established. Furthermore, the differences to equations

  abstract = {Measurements of the transient photocurrent I(t) in an increasing number
	of inorganic and organic amorphous materials display anomalous transport
	properties. The long tail of I(t) indicates a dispersion of carrier
	transit times. However, the shape invariance of I(t) to electric
	field and sample thickness (designated as universality for the classes
	of materials here considered) is incompatible with traditional concepts
	of statistical spreading, i.e., a Gaussian carrier packet. We have
	developed a stochastic transport model for I(t) which describes the
	dynamics of a carrier packet executing a time-dependent random walk
	in the presence of a field-dependent spatial bias and an absorbing
	barrier at the sample surface. The time dependence of the random
	walk is governed by hopping time distribution Ψ(t). A packet, generated
	with a Ψ(t) characteristic of hopping in a disordered system [e.g.,
	Ψ(t)∼t-(1+α), 0{\textless}α{\textless}1], is shown to propagate with
	a number of anomalous non-Gaussian properties. The calculated I(t)
	associated with this packet not only obeys the property of universality
	but can account quantitatively for a large variety of experiments.
	The new method of data analysis advanced by the theory allows one
	to directly extract the transit time even for a featureless current
	trace. In particular, we shall analyze both an inorganic (a-{As2Se3)}
	and an organic (trinitrofluorenone-polyvinylcarbazole) system. Our
	function Ψ(t) is related to a first-principles calculation. It is
	to be emphasized that these Ψ(t)'s characterize a realization of
	a non-Markoffian transport process. Moreover, the theory shows the
	limitations of the concept of a mobility in this dispersive type
	of transport.},

  abstract = {In mammals, mitochondria and mitochondrial {DNA} {(mtDNA)} are transmitted
	through the female germ line. Mature oocytes contain at least 100,000
	copies of {mtDNA}, organized at 1–2 copies per organelle. Despite
	the high genome copy number, {mtDNA} sequence variants are observed
	to segregate rapidly between generations, and this has led to the
	concept of a developmental bottleneck for the transmission of {mtDNA.}
	Ultrastructural investigations of primordial germ cells show that
	they contain approximately 10 mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial
	biogenesis is arrested during early embryogenesis, and that the mitochondria
	contributing to the germ cell precursors are simply apportioned from
	those present in the zygote. Thus, as few as 0.01\% of the mitochondria
	in the oocyte actually contribute to the offspring of the next generation.
	Mitochondrial replication restarts in the migrating primordial germ
	cells, and mitochondrial numbers steadily increase to a few thousand
	in primordial oocytes. Genetic evidence from both heteroplasmic mice
	and human pedigrees suggests that segregation of {mtDNA} sequence
	variants is largely a stochastic process that occurs during the mitotic
	divisions of the germ cell precursors. This process is essentially
	complete by the time the primary oocyte population is differentiated
	in fetal life. Analysis of the distribution of pathogenic {mtDNA}
	mutations in the offspring of carrier mothers shows that risk of
	inheriting a pathogenic mutation increases with the proportion in
	the mother, but there is no bias toward transmitting more or less
	of the mutant {mtDNAs.} This implies that there is no strong selection
	against oocytes carrying pathogenic mutations and that atresia is
	not a filter for oocyte quality based on oxidative phosphorylation
	capacity. The large number of mitochondria and {mtDNAs} present in
	the oocyte may simply represent a genetic mechanism to ensure their
	distribution to the gametes and somatic cells of the next generation.
	If true, {mtDNA} copy number, and by inference mitochondrial number,
	may be the most important determinant of oocyte quality, not because
	of the effects on oocyte metabolism, but because too few would result
	in a maldistribution in the early embryo. © 2007, Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Unlike wired networks, wireless networks do not come with links. Rather,
	links have to be fashioned out of the ether by nodes choosing neighbors
	to connect to. Moreover the location of the nodes may be {random.The}
	question that we resolve is: How many neighbors should each node
	be connected to in order that the overall network is connected in
	a multi-hop fashion? We show that in a network with n randomly placed
	nodes, each node should be connected to Θ(log n) nearest neighbors.
	If each node is connected to less than 0.074 log n nearest neighbors
	then the network is asymptotically disconnected with probability
	one as n increases, while if each node is connected to more than
	5.1774 log n nearest neighbors then the network is asymptotically
	connected with probability approaching one as n increases. It appears
	that the critical constant may be close to one, but that remains
	an open {problem.These} results should be contrasted with some works
	in the 1970s and 1980s which suggested that the "magic number" of
	nearest neighbors should be six or eight.},
