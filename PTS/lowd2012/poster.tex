We consider 1D, quasi-1D or 2D network with:
\beq
\frac{dp_n(t)}{dt} = \sum_m w_{nm} p_m(t)
\eeq
With $w_{nm}$ for the random site model:
\beq
w_{nm} =   \eexp{-|x_n-x_m|/\xi}  
\eeq
%
In the 1D case we consider also the following banded lattice model
%
\beq
w_{nm}  =   w_0  \eexp{-\epsilon_{nm}}  B(n-m)
\eeq


}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Diffusion}{name=diffusion,column=0, below=model}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{}

The long time dynamics are charectrized by the spreading $S(t)$, the survival probability $\mathcal{P}(t)$ and the spectral counting of states $\mathcal{N}(t)$. In the case of diffusion these are:
\begin{align}
S(t) &= \left\langle r^2(t) \right\rangle  =  (2d)Dt\ \\
\mathcal{P}(t) \quad &= \quad  \frac{1}{\left({4\pi D t}\right)^{d/2}} \\
\mathcal{N}(\lambda)  &\propto\left[\frac{\lambda}{D}\right]^{d/2} 
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{The $1d$ chain model}{name=chain,column=0,below=diffusion}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{} In the $1d$ chain model, the location of each site has a uniform random distribution on a $1d$ line.

The rates are calculated according to $w_{nm} = w_0 \exp(-|r_m-r_n|/\xi)$, with only nearest neighbor transitions
($b=1$). We can convert the spacing distribution to rate distribution, and, making the analogy with adding connectors in series, we obtain:
\beq
D = D[w_n] = \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_n \frac{1}{w_n} \right)^{-1} 
 =  \frac{s-1}{s} \, w_0
\eeq
for $s>1$, with $s=\xi/r_0$. For $0<s<1$, there is a sub diffusive regime, where the survival probability and spreading are:
\beq
S(t) \ \ &\propto& \ \ t^{2s/(1+s)}   \\ 
\mathcal{P}(t) \ \ &\propto& \ \ t^{-s/(1+s)}
\eeq
 These are exact analytic results, based on work by Shlomo Alexander, and they are summed up in panel (a) of figure \ref{fig:alexander}.

The linear response theorem will not hold for very "sparse" systems, because only percolating 
connections contribute to the transport. We define a percolation limit by requiring :
\beq
\iint_{w(r,\epsilon)>w*} \rho(r,\epsilon)drd\epsilon  =  p_c
\eeq
with $p_c$ of order unity.

Then we calculate $D$ as follows:

\beq
D_{\tbox{ERH}}[\bm{w}]  = \frac{1}{4}\iint \min\{w(r,\epsilon),w^*\}  r^2   \rho(r,\epsilon) d\epsilon dr
\eeq

  \headerbox{Banded Networks}{name=banded,column=1,span=2,above=bottom}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%If we had an ordered lattice, then the exact result for $D$ would be 
%
%\beq
%D  =  D_{\tbox{LRT}}[\bm{w}]   =  \frac{1}{2d}\iint w(r,\epsilon) \ r^2  \ \rho(r,\epsilon) \ d\epsilon dr 
%\eeq
%
%This expression is strictly {\em linear}.
%For the infinite temperature variation of 2D random site model we get  
%
%\beq
%D \ \ = \ \ 3\pi \, s^4 \, w_0
%\eeq
%
Now we consider quasi-1d networks, in which there is a band profile, meaning each site is connected to $b$ neighbor sites. The rates depend exponentialy on a random variable with a uniform distribution $[-\sigma,0]$.

%The linear response theorem will not work for ${s<1}$ because sparse contribution 
%of strongly coupled sites do not contribute to the transport. 
%Only percolating trajectories do have a contribution. The Effective-Range-Method is
%an approximation that takes connectivity into account. We define the effective rate 
%through the requirement 
%
%\beq
%\iint_{w(r,\epsilon)>w*} \rho(r,\epsilon)drd\epsilon  =  p_c, 
%\ \mbox{with $p_c$ of order unity}

%Then we calculate $D$ as follows:

%D \ \ = \ \ D_{\tbox{ERH}}[\bm{w}]  \ \ = \ \ \frac{1}{4}\iint \min\{w(r,\epsilon),w^*\} \ r^2  \ \rho(r,\epsilon) \ d%\epsilon dr
%\eeq
%
%This is similar to the LRT estimate, with network that has $w_{nm}$ 
%that are equal or smaller to the original values. The "suppressed" 
%connectors are those that are too sparse to form percolating trajectories. 
%Note that this expression, is {\em semi-linear} 
%rather than linear.

Modes with high participation numbers are extended and are more important for the long term behaviour. There is a striking difference between the $1d$ and $2d$ cases. For $1d$, the slope for sparse models ($s<1$) is less than $\frac{1}{2}$, meaning we have sub-diffusion. In the $2d$ case, the low-$\lambda$ slope is always $1$, which correspondes to normal diffusion.} \label{fig:exp_2d_D_vs_subD}
