\section{Diffusion or Subdiffusion in $2d$}

The question of diffusion in most $1d$ systems was analytically solved in \cite{alexander_excitation_1981}. 
The $2d$ case is, as far as we know, not yet analytically solved, and is much less clear. 
In \cite{amir_localization_2010} it is claimed that in low density systems subdiffusion of
order $\sim log^d$ should occur. We wish to examine these networks through their spectral
properties to find out if this is indeed the case. Our focus will be on low densities,
and on checking whether there exists a transition between low densities and high densities.


%%%%%%%%%
\section{Geometrical implications}

The aforementioned density changes are equivalent to rescaling of the system size,
while keeping the site locations in place, meaning that the geometry of the problem 
does not change. But does the geometry matter at all? Of course, the geometric properties
of the system are reflected in the statistics of the distances,
and by extension in the statistics of the transition rates. 
However, there is more information in the $W_{nm}$ matrix than just the statistics of its elements.
The question arises: Are the statistics all that is needed to understand the physics of the system? 
We shall check numerically if a randomized matrix with the same statistics behaves the same.

\section{Assymetric VRH}

The networks we have so far discussed are symmetric by definition. 
If the sites have different potentials, then the site occupation probabilites change. This can be acommodated for by modifying the transition rates by Boltzmann's factor. This is called \emph{VRH- Variable Range Hopping}\cite{ambegaokar_hopping_1971}, and has been widely studied. The common practice is to treat the system as a symmetric resistor network, but we want to ask if there are cases where this reduction to a symmetrical network is not valid.

\section{Banded sparse matrices}

The conductance of quasi-$1d$ banded sparse matrices was studied numerically in \cite{stotland_random-matrix_2010}. There, they use \emph{Variable-Range-Hopping} in the sparse regime, where 
$(\text{sparsity}\cdot \text{bandwidth}) \ll 1$. However, in this work it is not clear what are the limits on either sparsity or bandwidth, and in particular where is the cross between the validity regime of VRH and that of SLRT. We will try to understand this issue analytically. A specific version of these matrices were also studied in \cite{janssen_correlated_2000}.

% Could maybe add here an additional item from the notes if necessary.

\section{The spectral properties of Sinai diffusion in $1d$}

In a symmetric random rate system, there is regular diffusion if the harmonic average is bounded, i.e. if
%
\begin{align}
 \sum_n \frac{1}{w_n} < \infty 
\end{align}
%

On the other hand, for an asymetric system, an activation energy builds up, and a Sinai diffusion behaviour is followed.
The conductance is exponentially small in the length, and the spreading is anomalic. The difference between those two models is clearly highly significant. We wish to investigate the difference between the models, and the relation of this difference to the spectral properties of the model.

%%%%%%%%%
\section{Sinai diffusion in $2d$}

We shall inspect the spectral properties, and spreading behavior of a $2d$ asymmetric system. The
$2d$ case is much different than the $1d$ case, because particles can circumvent barriers. However,
a nearest neighbor lattice can be constructed to present the same long time spreading as the $1d$ lattice \cite{blumberg_selinger_diffusion_1989}.
The question is whether having nearest neighbor links only is a necessary condition for this behavior,
and how does this relate to the spectral properties of the $2d$ system.

\section{The charge carrier discreteness}\label{sec:discreteness}

Our work so far considered probability rate equations, which are valid for a single particle in the network.
If we have multiple interacting particles in the network, additional factors may contribute. For example,
a single occupancy rule (i.e. each site may have up to one particle) may cause Fermi blocking. Another
issue is that the single particle behavior might be sub-diffusive while the bulk spreading is diffusive \cite{richards_theory_1977,hung_diffusion_2012}.

\section{Generalization to a quantum state}

Up to now, we have concentrated on Markovian networks, dealing with the probabilities without phases.
We will try to generalize the work to solve Hamiltonian matrices of the same genre.

% (1d and 2d) are different sections.

% 1d . Having a site, with random rates, we have diffusion - harmonic average (less or equal to inf).
%      Now, if the rates are assymetric, we have sinai diffusion (Daniel).
%      The conductance is exponentially small in the length, which is very different from before.
%      The spreading is anomalic.

%      It is a general claim that an activation potential will be created for any random selection.
%      WHAT is the relation between Sinai's work and spectral properties? What about the temporal dependance.
%% This is important. Derrida doesn't have a solution. Write a page about the amazing difference between those
